Foreword


Prologue

Jiyoon stared at the girl with an ashamed look. - But I still think she's more beautiful...
- Obviously she is more beautiful, Jiyoonie... does this mean that you love her?

Being different in a straight world means pain, hate... it means that you will suffer in every way. In every corner of the walk of your life you make a decision. In every way you will somehow fail and somehow win. Making the wrong decision means death. Will Jiyoon make the right decision?


Chapter 1
Hypocrisy


She ran in the green meadow, holding the hand of the girl on her side. She could feel her breath on her neck, while she was running and pulling her. Exhausted, the two people sat on the tall grass, smiling at each other.

Her face was blurred, she knew it was all a dream. She could see her messy hair, which had the same colour of the sand, and her dark eyes, in which she could get lost. That girl was making her feel good.

 

Jiyoon woke up, in her bed.

 

Eyeing the window, she realized that the rain was falling hard, the sun rising on the horizon. Between her arms, Amber's slim body slept  quietly, without a noise, the short hair gently caressed by the older girl.

Jiyoon stared at the roof, her mind full of thoughts, and yawned. The girl knew she needed to cry, to let her frustration out somehow, but what was that for? Crying wouldn't have helped.

She was stronger, she couldn't permit herself to weaken. Amber needed her.

Almost three years had passed since she had been chased away from home, rejected by her own parents, and forced to become a grown person too soon.

Now she was a singer. Not a famous one, but still a public character, and she had to focus on her own career which was way harder that she had thought.

Jiyoon was supposed to be happy, but the girl couldn't feel happy at all.

The girl was going to wake up her sleeping girlfriend, who lay next to her. Softly, she patted her houlder, whispering some sweet words to make the younger girl wake up.

"Wake up, my little honey" - She said with a low voice. Amber opened an eye, groaning something incomprehensible as turned on the other side, falling asleep again.

With a smile on her face, Jiyoon patted Amber's short hair, and finally caught the latter's attention, giving her a peck on the lips - "Five minutes, Jiyoonie" - Amber pleaded.

Jiyoon couldn't withstand at the sight of her eyes. Those perfect brown eyeballs would always make her drown in the light of her eyes. 

She smiled and tried to sleep some minutes more, chasing away all the bad concerns that bothered her, and she finally managed to have some relax. 

Their first conversation came back to her mind, and she recalled that little caffè they firsly met in.

That girl is obviously gay. And pretty too, I might try to approach with her... Jiyoon had said when she had seen her for the first time. 

It was a quite bastard thought, but then when they started to talk, Jiyoon had forgot about her body. She had started looking at her captivating eyes. 

However, the life wasn't a bowl of cherries. The first time they slept togheter, Jiyoon had wept silently... the hypocrisy was unbearable.

 

"Are you hungry?" - Jiyoon said. She wasn't, but she also wanted to wake up from her day dreams, and eating could have helped. The younger girl nodded and sat on the bed, leaning a kiss onto the older's lips.

"I love you" - Amber said, holding her girlfriend's hand while she walked into the kitchen. The house was silent and nobody seemed to be awaken, when the two lovers started having breakfast. 

Jiyoon eyed the younger girl. Amber appeared honestly happy, the way she smiled foreshadowed calm and peace. On the other hand, the older was still thoughtfully staring at the roof. Wistful. Sad. Gloomy...

It wasn't a matter of love. She loved Amber with all her heart and she truly wanted to be happy with her... but hiding a relationship forever? It was different. Nobody should hide love, and a singer's career doesn't worth so much...

Two girls came into the room. The tallest of the two girl, sat on the couch and seemed to become upset, as she saw the couple exchanging a kiss. 

Hyuna made a fake disgusting face. - "Ehi, you two! I don't want to see your performance. Get a room..."

Grabbing some milk and a box cookies, the red-haired girl started preparing her breakfast, still giving a glance to the two lovers on the couch.

Whenever Jiyoon and Amber started making out passionately, a thrill of anger would run through her, and fill her mind with jealousy and rage...

She would just hide her feelings behind a mask of childishness and pretend that it was all normal. But behind the mask, she could see herself and Jiyoon, both suffering.

How could they be singers during the day, write and sing love songs if they kept everything inside themselves? At the end of the day, does being a singer change you?

Yes, it does. 

Compromises kill you slowly, making you suffer years and years before cracking you up. How can someone live without even having the freedom to love?


Chapter 2
Nice to meet you


In a Korean female Insitute, 2008

That school was pretty scary, seen from the outside with a gate that was awfully rusty and dirty. During that winter, the wheather had been really cold, and Jiyoon's jacket was ripped in many points, making the girl shiver.

A young women was leading her into the school. They walked up to the second floor, in which there were a lot of bedrooms, and she noticed how all of them were very small and narrow.

While the young girl was staring at the group of girls that had just passed, the women who had been leading her had stopped near one of the rooms. She glanced Jiyoon and started to explain the rules:

"This is your room. We have a few rules that you must follow... You must go to sleep at 10. Every morning you must have a shower, it's really important to do. The lessons start at 9am. Did you understand?"

"Yes, Mrs, I did" - she weakly answered.

"It's very late now , go to sleep" - she commanded.

Jiyoon went into the room, and started to look around, scared. There were 6 beds but she couldn't realize that 5 people will cohabit with her, from now. It was kind of surreal, and she wanted to cry, but refrained.

A little blond girl had been looking at her for a few minutes, with an inquisitive glance. The blond girl approached to her and sat on the bed near Jiyoon's. That seemed to be her bed.

"Hi, are you a new girl?" - The weird girl said, moving away her sandy hairs.

"Y-yes?" - Jiyoon replied, feeling very unsecure.

"Don't be scared, babygirl, I don't bite... at least I won't bite you... You looks like one of those girl that always look around and get aroused for nothing, aren't you?" - she said with a smirk.

"Huh?" - Jiyoon was studying the girl. What did that statement mean?

"You're face is priceless. You are gay. aren't you?" - She said with a laughter - "I'm Gayoon, the girl with the best gay radar around here. Nice to meet you." - Jiyoon felt very shocked, but shook her hand. 

She had clearly heard a bunch of butterflies in the stomach, and stood there, unable to utter a word, still unsure if she would rape her or not.

"Then, what's your name?" - said Gayoon.

"Oh, yeah... I'm... Jiyoon, nice to meet you too"

That strange smile, that way to talk with a secure voice. It looked like the girl was trying to hook up with her and Jiyoon wondered whether the girl was gay as well.

"Don't ever wonder if someone is gay or not in a female school, babygirl..." - Gayoon continued - "Everyone here is gay. Even if you are not gay when you come, you become that. There are no boys around here."

She seemed to be sad and Jiyoon understood.

"But you seem to have a lot of experience, right?"

Gayoon looked at her. - "You are not that fool..."

"I was sent here because I'm gay." - Jiyoon was kind of happy now, it looked like having a friend. Jiyoon kept speaking - "I slept with a girl. I mean, I didn't have sex with her, I just... slept." - Jiyoon blushed.

She had always thought about sex as a sin... Now, for the first time, she was ashamed because she had never had.

"Don't be ashamed, babygirl... I'll teach you how to bite people before they could bite you." - she smirked.

About 2 hours later.

Later, in the dark, Gayoon slipped on Jiyoon's bed while she was still awake. Jiyoon felt her warmth, and though she was not understanding, and not wanting to feel, she felt the arousal grow in the other girl.

"Shush... I'm not going to rape you"  - Gayoon had whispered. Now the blond girl was really close to Jiyoon, wearing only the underwears. - "I just wanted to check if you are fine..."

"What's happening here?" - An older girl turned on the light on and glanced at Gayoon. - "You dirty whore, are you trying to fuck the new girl?".

Then she looked at the half-naked girl who blushed and covered herself. - "You are breaking a couple of rules, aren't you?" - She jocked, the other three girls laughing. Jiyoon felt she wanted to die.

"I think whe should teach a lesson to you, Gayoon" - the girl showed her evil smirk. Jiyoon was obviously afraid. Crazily afraid. This is more than a prison. She is going to beat up her. - "I don't think you are allowed to fuck anybody while I'm sleeping".

Gayoon felt shocked, and also insulted, but she replied ever more strongly.

"Of course not... I mean... yes... Where's the problem Hye-jin? Do you want to join us?" - she blurted. Jiyoon looked at her, feeling betrayed. Are you crazy Gayoon? Would you get into troubles just to have sex?

"Can't you just musturbate?" - Gayoon's mocking was very brutish. Her sunken eyes revealed she was very tired, and her bestial glance was crying vengeance. She was fighting for Jiyoon, but she wouldn't like this. This is violence, free and unmotivated violence.

Hye-jin hit Gayoon strongly, and blood started flowing from her jaw. One kick, one more. She lyed on the floor. Gayoon tried to give her a punch but the other girls blocked her. She deviated hair from her eyes and suddenly stood up. She rushed towards the older girl, while another one pulled her hair.

"Now we will have fun with your new girlfriend... you look so pathetic, Gayonnie, I can't stand you." - I'm dead, I don't want to be raped my first night.

"Do... not... touch... her" - Gayoon was crying, but forcibly freed herself and beat Hye-jin. Jiyoon started crying too while the door opened allowing a woman burst into the room and shout:

"What the hell is happening? Are you raping this baby, Jeung?" - She said with some kind of amused voice... - "She is at least 16 years old, what are you doing, Jeung? Do you like babies?" - She laughed.

"I'm 18" - said the sandy-haired girl with a brutal face. - "And she didn't rape me".

"Why are you half-naked, then?" - the woman laughed - "By the way, pick up some clothes, you are disgusting. Jeung Hye-jin, you will come with me. This night you will rape a pillow, at least... there's nothing to look at..." - she glanced at the other 3 girls.

They returned to bed while the woman was leading Hye-jin away. Later, Jiyoon in the dark went close to Gayoon and whispered:

"Thanks..."

Gayoon smiled. First day and I had a chance to be raped. Good achievement, Jiyoon, good achievement. And I have already a friend who has a crush on me. She fought, just for me? Or was she just looking for my body? I am sure, Gayoon, I love you, but I will never... never have sex with you.


Chapter 3
I'd like to be free


San Josè, United States of America, 2010

In California the weather was sunny and the sun shone with a plenty of light. A cool feeling had invaded the two girls' bodies when they had come into the little cafè with the air conditioning turned on...

Amber smiled widely at her girlfriend and sat on her lap.

Quiet, Jiyoon, it's all ok. In America a lot of girls sit on her bestfriend's lap. Jiyoon ordered two cups of coffee and gave to Amber her hand. Forthwith released it and blushed, trying to go unnoticed.

She  eyed her girlfriend. Amber seemed to be really happy at that moment and she was busy staring at her and pouting with her cutest face. The overload of cuteness made her gain a smile from Jiyoon.

- I want to kiss you - she whispered near Jiyoon's ear. She shook her head to chase away her thoughts. I am paranoid. Here no one cares if I'm gay neither if I'm a singer. She was awfully stressed and couldn't help but keep doing nervous gestured.

- Let's go home, honey - Jiyoon pleaded with a low voice... - I'm tired.

As soon as Amber had nodded yes, the two girls wore their jackets and came out of the cafè. Jiyoon anxiously eyed her clock to check the time. She was overly musing and Amber noticed how she were in tension, and she hugged tightly her girlfriend to relieve her body.

- I love you so much... - she whispered.

When they arrived home, it was 8pm. Jiyoon rang the bell and Sohyun came to open the door. When they came in, Gayoon was, as always she do, sleeping on the couch. Jiyoon sat onto the armchair while Amber ceught her, sitting onto her lap.

- Hey, Gayonnie! Wake up - Jiyoon laughed - What a idler! - Gayoon had already awoken and she threw a pillow toward Jiyoon, without a word.

- Shut up! - Gayoon she managed to yawn loudly and stared at the couple. Amber attempted to tease her girlfriend, kissing her neck, and she gained a death glare from Gayoon that had been staring for a while at them, not happy to have been awoken

- Why on earth do you need to wake me up if you two are kissing blissfully...? - she shouted - ...I would have liked to sleep some more... - Gayoon tumbled again on the couch.

- I need to talk you - Jiyoon tried to apologize. Gayoon rumbled and stood up - Come with me - They went to Jiyoon's bedroom, and Gayoon sat on the desk's chair while the owner of the room sat on her bed, shunning a pair of shos that had been left on the ground.

- Spit it out, babygirl - Gayoon stared at her. - Why are you being so sad these days? - The blond girl became very serious.

- I hate being supervised by Jihyun... earlier, when we was at the cafè, I gave hand to Amber, and... Obviously I had to control myself and leave it... I'd like to be free and gain some more privacy for myself! - Jiyoon was almost crying...

- Even with my girlfriend, I have secrets. She asked me about my trainee days, and I didn't utter a word. Jihyun has forbidden us to talk about our... past to anybody...

She was crying quite loudly, when somebody opened the door and stared at the two girls... Jiyoon panicked, seeing her ginger hair. Hyuna questioningly stared at Gayoon, trying to figure out what were going on.

- Piss off - Gayoon said with a brutish glare - This is supposed to be a private gathering! - Gayoon tried to push Hyuna out to the room.

- What are you crying about, Ji? Pur your hands to yourself, Gayoon! - she shouted. Gayoon freed the girl and stared at Jiyoon. What should I do? she asked mentally. Let she enter, Jiyoon answered. - Why are you crying? - the younger girl asked.

- It's difficult to understand, for you - Jiyoon started, but Hyuna got angry.

- I'm 18 years old, I'm not such a kid, Jeon Ji-yoon, and I care about you. So, spit it out! - It's difficult to understand for someone who haven't lived her life into a military school, fool kid, Gayoon thoughts as she stared at Hyuna.

- I'm not talking about your age, Hyun-ah - Jiyoon said carefully. - Gayoon is right, this is a private gathering...

Later, into Hyuna's bedroom. 21pm.

Hyuna was crying near the Window. I'm not such a kid, Jiyoonnie. I care about you... I love you. Due the tropical climate, in California it was raining. I love you so much, why don't you notice? Hyuna stared at the dark sky blankly due to her sadness.

A low noise filled the air and, slowly, Jihyun opened the door. Then, she noticed Hyuna was crying, and put a hand on her shoulder, gently.

- Let me know what are you crying about. I'd like to help you, Hyun-ah... - Jihyun stared at the younger girl, with her maternal gaze - You got me... - Hyuna looked back at her, and swiped tears from her face, feeling compelled to trust her.

- Jiyoon is suffering. She doesn't even want to tell me why and, you know Jihyun, I really care about her - Hyuna said in one breath. She lowered her voice, almost whispering - I love her...

- I already know that you like her, Hyun-ah - Hyuna stared at Jihyun with an incredulous look - and I see, Jiyoon is suffering. She doesn't want to talk with me about that as well, and I understand... - Hyuna was crying loudly, now.

- It's due to Amber, I know it! - she shouted - I... I hate her, I think. Jihyun swiped Hyuna's tears and hugged her.

- Jiyoon loves Amber, Hyun-ah. Life is unfair, but we need smile back at it - Jihyun slowly left Hyuna's arms and came out of the bedroom - Good night, Hyuna... Good night.


Chapter 4
Tears and regrets


South Korea, 2008.

The weather was cloudy and the dark horizon, full of lightnings, was announcing a storm while Jiyoon and Gayoon were sitting on a rusty bench in the schoolyard. Jiyoon was lost into her own thoughts, busy staring blankly at the sky, when Gayoon softly put an hand onto her shoulder.

- Can I know what happened...? I mean... why has your family sent you here - she said carefully. The girl was torn between the awkwardness that had been rising with her and the affection... a feeling that she didn't use to feel.

Jiyoon, trying to recall memories, looked at the other one straight into the eyes... - This summer, I met a girl... - she started slowly - ...I already knew that I liked women and I fell in love with her, but I she didn't know, and I had been hiding it for a while... One evening I hugged her, I confessed to her, but my mother heard it all... -

Jiyoon had already started to dry her limpid tears, trying to continue to talk... - She chased her away and then she beat me.... - more tears came from Jiyoon's eyes, flowing onto her cheeks that were gently caressed by the blond girl.

- That's horrible, Jiyoon - Gayoon seriously looked at her - A few people could understand what does being rejected by their own parents mean...

- ...one month later, she enrolled me in this school, and meanwhile, the girl I used to like denied to love me, and she broke my heart definitively... - Gayoon hugged her new best friend. I understand.

- And... you? How did you come here? - Jiyoon turned head towards hers, taking a handkerchief from her pocket.

Gayoon closed her eyes and sank into her memories. - ...I was 13 years old. My father was gone, and my mother was an alcoholic. - Jiyoon stared shookedly at Gayoon.

- ...I was entrusted with my older sister Gabrielle for a few years... She abused me many times, but she didn't want to take care me... So she enrolled me in here... Actually, social services enrolled me her, but I'd rather have continued to fuck my own sister than coming her, but apparently it is unlawful.

When the blond girl brokenly finished the sentence, it started raining. Gayoon didn't want to cry, but tears started to flow slowly from her dark eyes, just like the rain wet the sky. She looked down, frustrated while Jiyoon hugged her back.

- Your sister a-abused you? - she said carefully, thinking back at her childhood. Aside from her traditional family, Jiyoon has been fine, living in a little town, with food, money and clothes. Though the severity of her family, it was nothing compared to Gayoon.

- Babygirl? - Gayoon said with broken voice - Do you believe in love? - Jiyoon looked at her friend. Yes, I do... or do I? I mean, I love you, but not as a girlfriend, but as my hero.

- No, I don't - she said carefully - I couldn't at any rate wed, same-sex marriage is not allowed! - Gayoon laughed. I made her smile... Jiyoon thoughts.

Gayoon slid her hand on Jiyoon's thighs, and whispered near her ear - Do you believe in sex? - Jiyoon blushed. She was flying in the heaven at that moment. - I'd better go, Gayoon... I don't want to mess up things even more between us...

- Erm Erm! What's going on? - A schoolmistress was staring at the two girls. Jiyoon blushed violently, noticing Gayoon's hand on her lap.

On the other hand Gayoon glanced at the woman with an annoyed glare. The teacher approached to the bench - Are you two planning to wed one of these days? - the woman said sarcastically - I do not admit any sex act in my schoolyard. Out of here! We are going to my office.

Gayoon was going to react. Jiyoon grabbed her arm. Don't ever get into fights for me, ok? she thoughts and Gayoon understood.

They walked out of the yard, following the teacher. When they arrived at her office, the woman turned the knob, and came in - Well... well... well! Here we got two girls. They were making out in the schoolyard! - the woman sighed...

- Heo Gayoon, what should I do with you? You beat the other girls, you skip lessons... and now you were making out with the new girl... in my schoolyard - She was repeating, as if she didn't believe - You're the perfect bully. You should take drug! - she laughed.

- Punish me, but do not touch her...

- I don't mean to punish you, Gayoon. It's just useless. My job is to make you understand the rules, understood? I don't like shameless girls.

- I didn't even kiss her... - Gayoon shouted. She still had her eyes wet with tears.


Chapter 5
I like women


San Josè, United States of America, 2010

- Girls, get ready in ten minutes, we're late - Jihyun was shouting from the entrance while the other girls were frantically fixing make ups, dressing and cleaning themselves.

Jiyoon opened a closet, looking for a pair of sunglasses, though they weren't there, and so she walked to the bathroom door. - Hyun-ah, did you see my sungla... oh, sorry... - she giggled.

When she opened the door, Hyuna covered herself with a towel since she was entirely naked. She blushed violently, tightening the bathrobe and hiding herself behind the sink - No, I d-didn't - she replied.

- Never mind, I'll pick up another pair. Nice tattoo, by the way... - she teased, chuckling slightly to the detriment of the shy girl, who ran towards her bedroom quicly.

Gayoon was lying quietly on the couch, when Jihyun called her from the kitchen, while she was busy reorganizing a bunch of papers in the bag... - Gayoooon! ...Wake Up! Jihyun shouted.

The blond girl mumbled an insult towards Jihyun, while she was stretching. She stood up slowly, to go to the bedroom. Seeing her slowness, Jihyun was getting out of mind... - Our first Radio Interview and we're late! I can't believe... Let's go! - she shouted once again.

- I'm ready, Jihyun - Hyuna was still blushing due to the misadventure with Jiyoon - ...Me too... - Sohyun appeared from the bedroom on the left in the corridor. The two maknaes took the jacket and came out of the room, coming towards the exit

- Here we are - Jiyoon and Gayoon arrived a few seconds later. Gayoon was still a little bit sleepy and was looking randomly around the environment, absent-mindedly.

- So we are ready to go... Finally - Jihyun emphasized the last word, glaring at the blond girl who didn't bother to return the gaze.

Entering into the car, Jihyun assumed a serious look, announcing a speech equally serious - I must explain a few rules... First, I hope you will speech with a seemly english grammar...

She stared for a couple of seconds at the other girls just to make sure to have gained their attention... - ...No puzzling statements, no useless ramblings and, the most important, NO sexual jokes, understood?

Gayoon smirked, licking her lips just for the pleasure of teasing Jihyun.

She resumed the speech, with a stern voice... - Even if someone ask you about your sexual life... you must reply 'I'm not comfortable talking about these things' with an innocent giggle. Most of you doesn't have any, so this is not a big deal.

- Are you trying to insinuate something? - Gayoon muttered, with clenched teeth. Jihyun looked at her with some kind of fear and and quickly looked away... - Of course not, I was just kidding... - she giggled - I'm sorry - Gayoon relaxed and smiled with her evil smile - ...I was sure it was so - she whispered near Jihyun ear.

The blond girl grinned, earning a giggle from the other three girls though Nathan, the manager, was shaking his head, in the front seat. They are going to do something stupid, I know... -  Gayoon, don't be violent, I still need a leader - he mumbled...

They arrived at the studio on time, though Jihyun kept staring at her clock, convinced to be late. A woman welcomed them and led them into the atrium, and then into the correct room.

The woman introduced their name to a tall man, who was wearing a blue jacket and didn't seem to be happy to be there - Hi girls, This is David Anderson, the conductor - the woman said. Jihyun shook his hand and introduced the other girls:

- Hi, I am Jihyun, the leader. They are the main vocalist Gayoon, main rapper Hyuna, lead vocalist Jiyoon and maknae Sohyun. Nice to meet you - Jihyun smiled nicely, as she never did before.

- I already knew... - he said with a cold voice. - Let's go, we are on air in four minutes. It's funny, ain't it? - Aside from the terrible joke, Jiyoon didn't like David Anderson.

All the girls sat on their chairs and wore their headphones. On the table there were 6 microphones and Sohyun was staring with admiration at the electronic equipment, since she was quite geeky. A man appeared and signed the seconds left before the airing. 4... 3... 2... 1...

- Good morning y'all, here is David Anderson, on 101.0 fm and this is Undergrounders! We are proud to present the 4Minute, a new Hip Hop girl-group... They comes from Korea and they just released her debut album, Hit your Heart... Hi girls! - The girls said 'hello!' together, giggling.

David looked at Jihyun - Here we have Jihyun, the leader of the group. So, can you tell us something about your group, Jihyun? - ...Jihyun charismatically took the microhpone.

- Hi David, We're going fine. We are selling a lot with Hit your heart, and we are going to release the first Music video in a week... - it was a lie. The album didn't sell more than 10k of copies.

David then looked towards Gayoon. He grabbed again the microphone and started with the first questions - Gayoon, I'd like to ask... - she became concentrated - you have been presented as the strong character... would you like to rap in some songs? We're all surprised to see you as the main vocalist...

Challenge accepted - I'm violent enough in real life, I don't want to shock people - she explained, earning a shocked glare from the journalist. Jihyun glanced at her, furiously. David didn't seem to notice the leader's glare, and Gayoon smiled widely to offset the awkwardness.

- Nice... Let's move on and talk with Jiyoon - Jiyoon was a little bit scared about the question. I hope he will ask me about my sunglasses - Jiyoon, we've seen a lot of idol falling in love. We wonder what kind of boy you like... -

She nervously looked at Jihyun who was almost praying. This was all a tease, journalists love asking akward questions... She shouldn't react. She should stay quite and comply with the agreements.

- Well, I'm not... comfortable to talk about these... things... - she babbled. Jihyun breathed a sigh of relief, while David continued to tease her -  Is there a singer you like? - the conductor was smiling overly and onto the nearest chair Jihyun was going to explode.

Jiyoon, on the other hand, was annoyed, and angry. She replied a 'no' while anger began to rise - You sure? - Jiyoon exploded:

- Yes, I am pretty sure that I like women...


Chapter 6
I will sing you a song


South Korea, 2008

The two girls with the ripped uniform snapped to attention. Jiyoon didn't eat anything at the morning, and she was about to puke while the lieutenant was glancing at her. - Are you a softy, soldier? - she asked, teasing. Jiyoon turned her head towards the woman. - No, I am not, mrs. - during the training session Jiyoon collapsed and lyed on the ground many times.

- What a great show of strength, soldier - In the undergrowth, all the other girls laughed, except for Gayoon, who was trying to remain calm. The lieutenant grabbed her cheeks forcibly and slapped Jiyoon - Wake up from your dreams, softy...

During the warm up, Jiyoon ran with breathlessness. This is going to kill me, I am sick, stupid woman, why don't you notice? the girl thought. Gayoon stepped towards her and posed an hand onto Jiyoon's shoulder - Do you want me to kick her ass? - she whispered with a smirk near Jiyoon's ear. Jiyoon shook his head denying - Don't get into troubles...

After the training session Gayoon went to the showers while Jiyoon remained in the wood. She leaned against a tree and vomited.

A little group of 5 girls laughed at the sight of Jiyoon, who was vomiting. A skinny girl with a blond plait started to tease Jiyoon... - You're strenght is comparable to my granny's. What's going on, did you spend all the night partying with Gayoon? - the other girls giggled.

- Still better than you. Yesterday, at the gym, you didn't even managed to walk on a freaking beam - Jiyoon replied calmly - and I am also sick... let's wait me untill I recover - Jiyoon leaned again against the tree and vomited once more time. The skinny girl frowned - I can walk on the beam. Yesterday I just lost my balance - Jiyoon was feeling a little guilty.

She is really young. Jiyoon thought. It's unfair, she is just trying to be respected. While the girl was going away, Jiyoon called her. - Wait... - the little girl stopped - What's your name? - she was incredulous, and stared questioningly at the older girl.

- Min-ji... - she finally babbled. Jiyoon just nodded and replied - I am sorry Min-ji... I'm sure you either didn't want to insult me - Min-ji nodded.

Jiyoon left the little girl to reach Gayoon in the dorm.  When she arrived, Gayoon was already undressed, despite it was only 9pm. Jiyoon immediately asked to Gayoon about Min-ji...

- Yes, I know her. Her father is a drug addict... did she tease you, babygirl? - Gayoon laid lazily on her bed, while Jiyoon was undressing to go bed. Meanwhile, in the opposite side of the dorm Hye-jin looked frustrated and was combing herself.

- Yes, she did, but she just needed attention... by the way, why is she so sad? - Jiyoon hinted at Hye-jin. Gayoon went closer to Jiyoon and whispered - I heard that she tried to approach with a girl... a very young girl. Do you remember what the lieutenant said the first night? She tought that she was raping me... and now she was seen with a fifteen... Everybody think she is a crazy pedophile - Gayoon smirked happily.

- Who is that girl? - Jiyoon asked. - I really don't know. I'm not really friendly with the surveillance, so I'm not addict with this kind of news - Gayoon changed the subject - Babygirl... do you like singing? - Jiyoon widened her eyes due the strange question.

- I'm quite good at singing, but I don't really like it... but I know you do. I heard you while you was showering... - Jiyoon smiled and Gayoon violently blushed. - I don't sing when I'm showering. Do I? - she said with shyness. Jiyoon giggled and returned to the main speech. - By the way, why did you ask? - she said.

- Extracurricular courses... - she started - if you join the singing course you skip a lot of training sessions. I wonder if you want to join that course with me... - Gayoon is a very good singer. Plus I won't need to puke around. - Yes, I will. - Gayoon was pretty excited and hugged Jiyoon. She had never seen Gayoon so cheerful.

- What are you looking at, babygirl? - Gayoon felt awkward. Jiyoon was staring at her with a giggle. - I'm looking at you... I never saw you so excited before - Gayoon laughed at the statement, still feeling awkward but happy. I found your weakness, naughty girl. - Then, I will sing you a song... - Gayoon hugged again Jiyoon, tightly.

Can you love someone only as a friend, though you love all about her? Can you love someone only as your hero, if she let you to smile whenever you look at her eyes? At the end of the day, she is your girlfriend. You just don't have sex.


Chapter 7
Confess


The young journalist grabbed the microphone and smiled. There weren't a large crowd of people, as it was supposed to be for an emerging group. Her co-worker was puffind.

- I told you we shouldn't have come here... We had the possibility to go to the SNSD's performance, and we ended up watching these unknown girls.

A man opened the turnstiles, and Rebecca came inside with the other people. - We are coming in... shut up and enjoy the night... - The crowd pushed the journalist into the small club.

Rebecca looked at the stage, seeing the spotlights intensifying... A DJ was playing as usual a loud music, waiting for the performance. Jiyoon suddenly appeared and, grabbing a microphone, she gained the attention of the whole club.

The journalist stared at the stage, foreshadowing something unusual.

- Hi San Francisco... - Jiyoon began.

1 hours earlier, dressing room

In the dressing room, there was a weird silence. On the couch, Gayoon and Sohyun was sitting thoughtfully while Jihyun was walking back and forth around the room. The tension was visible while the time of the performance was approaching.

- Ok girls... This is going to be a mess. I know you two would like an emotional speech, but I wish you will keep in mind that this is a commercial operation. Our manager along with Victoria agreed to do this only because this could interest some kind of...audience...

Jiyoon had a bitter look, so lost into her own thought that she couldn't focus on her word. Surprisingly, she just stood up and she hugged her... - Thank you, Jihyun, we appreciate. - Jihyun simplynodded at her statement, and sat onto the chair.

Hyuna was glaring with jealousy at the couple, and Sohyun noticed the weird look of her. Then, she approached at her friend and whispered - Why do you stare so at them? What did they do? - The girl moved nervously a lock of hair, and looked at her best friend.

- I'm not staring at them, I'm just thoughfully. You know, this is going to be very difficult for Jiyoonnie, and we need to... share support to her... - she babbled. Sohyun nodded unconvinced. She kept to watch Hyuna while the latter kept watching towards Jiyoon and Amber.

A young skinny girl came into the dressing room trough the door. - Only ten minutes left, Jihyun unni - she said. Jihyun nodded and began to fix her make-up. Jiyoon turned to the blond girl. - Min-ji, can you handle a commission for me, please? - the young girl straightened her plait and blushed, proudly. - Of course I can, Jiyoon unni.

Jiyoon whispered something at her ear and Min-ji nodded. Gayoon stared at Jiyoon, and she noticed that. - What do you want? - she mumbled. Gayoon turned away the head, as if she were saying oh, screw it!.

10 minutes later, Min-ji came back and calmly whispered - Let's go. - The time seemed to freeze when Jiyoon slowly started to walk towards the stage. She was afraid, terribly afraid of that moment...

Spotlights were intensifying in slow motion and indistinct sounds were making noise into Jiyoon's head. Panic. This is panic Jiyoon thought. Offhand the silence emptied the stage and the rest of the stadium. Pain, anxiety, anger. Jiyoon's head was going to explode under the pressure... mechanically, she grabbed the microphone.

- Hi San Francisco... - the crowd, instead of the usual shouts, applauded. Dazed, Jiyoon approached at the edge of the stage.

- Dear fellows... - she began with a broken voice. The crowd had joined in a strange silence, that is usually replaced by noises and shouts. A tear began to slip onto her cheeks.

Tightening the microphone, she slowly began to talk - A lot of you probably are here to dance... to drink... to sing, and the most of you don't want to hear these words. But I'm not going to stay silent...

Some people nodded curiously, keeping the weird silence in the hall... - Two days ago I've been forced to follow the rules of this society... I've been forced to hide myself and my thoughts in our first Radio Interview, but I'm tired of following rules...

More people nodded in agreement. - ...Choose your sexual tastes is a human right, and I won't to give it up... Homosexuality is a reality in this world, and I'm tired of hiding myself. My career doesn't worth as much as my love life.

The other girls came on the stage, followed by Amber and Min-ji. The younger girl opened a package, whose contained a ring along with a bouquet. - Amber Josephine Liu, I love you, and I won't hide our relationship... do you love me? - Amber blushed violently.

Astonished she nodded and babbled - Yes, I do. - the crowd hailed the couple.

Hyuna visibly frowned. - It would be useful share your support... - Sohyun teased her.


Chapter 8
Weakness


Mountain View, United States

In the dimly lit bedroom, a girl pulled the blinds and sat on the bed. A little moan came from the person whom was sleeping. When the younger girl let the light enter, she groaned louder. - Do not whine, Becky - began, caressing her sleeping beauty whom stood up and stared at her. She moved away her blond tufts.

- Sooyoung, I don't mean to hurt you, but you must leave me alone... though I wanted to see you too - Rebecca patted her cheeks softly and looked at the younger girl with a twinge. - I really don't mean to hurt you... she whispered.

Sooyoung pouted at her statements, still sitting on the bed. She took off her shoes and laid under the blanket. Rebecca's half naked body shivered, feeling the warmth of her ex-girlfriend. - Why do you want to help me? I cheated on you, alright? I was wrong, and you left me, Sooyoung. I don't want to force you to live with a girl whom sleep around for work... I'm a journalist, that's my work.

The younger girl pouted deeper. - I love you... and I was wrong too, Becky. I denied you a sexual life, I was awful selfish. Forgive me... I can't just understand your obsession... - Rebecca wanted to cry at that moment. Her tired eyes were staring at Sooyoung.

- I don't want to hurt you, Sooyoung. You're too young and too sinless to be my girlfriend. I'm sorry... - Sooyoung stood up from the bed and began to walk back and forth around the chaotic bedroom. She was feeling astonished and kind of humiliated. Rebecca tryed to grab her hand, but failed.

- I'm not a kid, Becky - she cried - If there's someone with which I want to make... a sin... - Sooyoung blushed - That person is you. Because I love you, Rebecca Jackson, and even your obsession for her won't make me give up! Untill I die, I will love you... and I will help you - she shouted with anger. Then, she calmed and softly asked - what did you discover?

4Minute's House, San Josè

Hyuna was sitting near the fireplace, sadly. Her long sighs were filling the room, until Jihyun came into the latter. Upset, she shook her head and sat near the little girl and posed an hand onto her shoulder.

Hyuna shivered, while a tear was flowing over her cheeks. Jihyun softly began to talk... - I know you are suffering teddybear, but I can't help with that. I must say that you should go out with your friends more often and forget about Jiyoon. 

Forget about Jiyoon? Did you drink unni? - I'm not thinking about Jiyoon, unni... - Jihyun grabbed her hand and held it tightly, maternally. - I know you are... let's wipe these tears and go to sleep. Tomorrow you must promise me you won't stay at home whining and you will go out with Sohee, alright?

The little girl nodded and a smile rised onto her face. She went to undress in her room. Jihyun smiled at the sight of her smile and stood up. Ah the sunset... Beautiful as always... she thought. Leaning against the window, she kept watching the sun's greetings for a while. I think I should check if she's fine thought.

Stepping towards Hyuna and Sohyun's bedroom, she heard footsteps from the balcony. Curious, she went to see what was happening. Carefully, with stealthy step, she looked into the terrace. Two people were talking with a low voice. Jihyun kept herself hid to prevent them to see her.

- Babygirl... be careful! she is suspicious of you, and I can't blame her. You just revealed the world that you were in that school, in that year and you left the latter in those days. Can I trust you, babygirl?

- You know you can... and I haven't done anything wrong... I have never taken drugs, you know. And what about you? - Jiyoon asked painfully. Gayoon looked down, ashamed. She stared at the other girl and replied with a broken voice - I stopped... - she clenched her fists, trying to get over her tears.

- Liar... - Jihyun was astonished and kept staring at the two girls, still hidden. - I won't tell anyone, but tell me the truth. I already told you, you can trust me...

Gayoon didn't manage to keep her tears. Jiyoon hugged her, feeling warm tears flowing on her shoulder. She patted slowly her friend who was mumbling, still crying loudly. - I s-swear... I will stop... - Hearing a noice, both girls turned their head towards the glass door. Someone just dropped a flower pot, astonished, and kept staring at the two girls.

- Jihyun......


Chapter 9
Leaden sky


South Korea, 2008

A leaden sky was surrounding the school that morning. It was quite early and few students was just chatting and walking back and forth in the yard.  A dreary environment as always could be seen in the school and a group of ravens made the feelings even more sad.

Gayoon peeked furtively at the yard and walked into the smaller trail. She was checking nervously her bag, while she was keeping to look around, scared to be seen from a teacher. Or worse, from her lieutenant. I see nobody is here... she thought, even more nervously, nobody is here.

She was clearly waiting for something or better for someone, as she kept staring so concentrated at the pathway. Suddenly, from her back, an older girl pulled her hairs tightly, earning her to drop a single tear. Gayoon was begging for breathe, while the girl whom surprisingly held her body released her and forcibly pushed her against the wall.

- Filthy slut, did you bring money? - she murmured with a bloody laugh. Gayoon freed herself with a jerk and stared, ashamed, at the girl... - Yes, unni, I did - she muttered. Her statement got her grinning like a madman. Again, she tightened Gayoon's body forcibly and tied her hands with a rope. - I know you did... you need my shit, hateful drug addict. You need it...

She suddenly rolled up her sleeve to find a deep cut on her arm. She grinned even deeper... - That's why... you absolutely need my painkillers, Heo Gayoon, right? - she laughed - does it hurt? - the older girl pushed away her dark hairs and pressed a finger on the cut - Gayoon groaned in pain, untill her tortuter covered with her hands her mouth.

While Gayoon was still tied, she found the money into her bag. She cheerfully took it, whereupon inserted a syringe into Gayoon's arm. Her muscles relaxed and she slowly stopped to scream. Tears, instead, was flowing on her cheeks. Despite her weakness, she stood up to prove her dignity. Her brutish glance turned into an ashamed sulk. - Ji-young unni... - she mumbled weakly. - don't leave me here... - Gayoon fell on the ground with a thud. Ji-young just left drugs into her pockets and went away. - Sweet dreams...

 

Jiyoon is just walking around, bored. She was wondering where Gayoon is. I thought she had lessons this morning, where the fuck is she? she thought. While coming back from the wood (Wherein she had a training session), she suddenly noticed she left her training suit at the dressing room.

She took a side trail whose pass trough the garden. She know Gayoon come here often. She come here to think over, ain't so? It's so beautiful around here... she was almost near the dorm when she heard a groan whose was coming from a clump of bushes. She went there to see what was happening, and she found Gayoon, asleep, whom was whining while sleeping.

Jiyoon rushed there, and slapped softly her cheeks. She was worried... - Gayoon, wake up! What did you do? Oh my... - Gayoon woke up, but it didn't seem she could utter a word. She weakly stood up and leaned against a tree.

- Ga... Gayoon, what did you do? Did you drink? Tell me - she asked, worried. Gayoon tried to shut her up, begging for her attention. - bring me at the d-dorm... fast... please Jiyoon h-help me. - Jiyoon held her up, and she led her to the dorm.

When they arrived, Jiyoon noticed the blood whose was flowing onto her arm. - Does it hurt? - she asked. Gayoon didn't feel the pain, under the influence of paracetamol. - I will take away your sweatshirt, stay firm... - the mention of her sweatshirt got Gayoon groan loudly. No... no don't find it... don't find it she prayed.

The box and the syringe fell on the ground. When Jiyoon picked them up, she closed her eyes to realize what she just found. Slowly, she breathed just to make sure that she is alive. Then, she shook Gayoon's body to wake her up. - Gayoon... Gayoon wake up! - Gayoon stood up, rubbing her temples. She felt ashamed...

- Forgive me, Jiyoon, please do not judge me - Jiyoon glanced at her best friend... - it hurts, it hurts a lot. Even without this cut, my life hurts and I don't want to feel the pain. When I go sleep I feel only shame and regrets... - she cried loudly. Jiyoon sat near her to comfort her daring hero. - I don't want to judge you, Gayoon... but I will make you stop...


Chapter 10
The blood's way


Mountain View, United States of America
- I will help you... - Sooyoung shouted, wiping her tears. The younger girl breathed slowly to regain control, though she was starting overt to cry... - What did you discover? 

Still staring at her, Rebecca sighed and took some papers from a closet. She put on her glasses and she started to tell to the girl what she discovered.
- Two years ago... an american dealer brought a drug payload around the world... The plan was to bring the drugs from Porto Rico to the Europe, then unto the North Korea.... it is called the Blood's way... Then launder the money into the Korean economy and bring money back in America... - Sooyoung was carefully listening the difficult speech, trying to understand.
- This could be possible only if someone bring the money bodily, since was no possible to transfer money without allowing the FBI to trace the transaction. It also would have been strange if a lot of money had arrived from North Korea to the States... do you understand? - Sooyoung nodded - but there was a small military school near the border with South Korea. Technically it is South Korea's land...
...well, Jeon Jiyoon was in that school untill she left the Korea. I was trying to prove it, but she admitted! some days ago during a performance she admitted that she actually was in that school and I think she also brought dirty money from the Korea - she stopped for a while.

- and so she brought a lot of bills? How? - Sooyoung asked.
- My theory is that Jeon brought back in the States the money under the shape of other drug... mainly painkillers and other analgesics... They are legal but also they need a prescription... - Rebecca took a breath before she continued - I told the federals but they don't believe me and the police is not involved... and so I...
- and so you slept with Gayoon to gather information? - Sooyoung murmured.4Minute's House, San Josè
After 10 minutes the doorbell rang loudly. Hyuna went to open while Sohyun was dressing up. A dark-haired skinny girl was standing up leaned against the wall. Hyuna smiled recognizing her best friend Sohee in front of her.
Sohee hugged tightly the other girl and entered in the house. While wiping her shoes, she looked around in the house and noticed that Sohyun wasn't here. - Where is Sohyunnie? - she asked. Hyuna turned the head towards Sohee and just replied - she is dressing. Let's go upstairs... but tell me about you, what did you do this month? It's a lot of time since we don't meet... - she excitedly began to talk, earning a wide smile from her friend.
- I've been wandering around for work. I have a chance to debut with the Wonder Girls, since the SNSD's manager rejected my request... Phff... they are already going to sign a contract with a strange girl called Sooyoung. I heard she is a pervert, you know... - Hyuna looked questioningly at the younger girl. She didn't get the meaning. Sohee lowered her voice - ...she likes women.
Hyuna refrained the urge to slap Sohee, though she assumed a serious expression. - I heard... - she started with anger - she has serious problems and she see a psycologist. Don't make fun of her...
- Ok, ok... don't be so harsh. Why should you take up her defense - she pouted. - do you like girls? - she laughed, ready to run away. But Hyuna didn't mean to run. She was just been humiliated.
- I wish you remember that Jiyoon and Gayoon like girls and they are my friends... - Hyuna pouted. Sohee just shrugged and came into the house with Hyuna. They went upstairs to reach Sohyun but when they arrived at Hyuna's bedroom the door was locked. - Sohyun? Yet dressing? - Hyuna yelled annoyed. Sohyun unlocked the door.
- Hey Sohyunnie, How's going? - she greeted the girl. - It has been a while since we met the last time, ain't? - Sohee and Sohyun hugged the each other, until Hyuna separated the two friends. - Are you ready Sohyun? - she asked. Sohyun nodded and took her purse.
- Sohyun, your jeans are unbuttoned - Sohee noticed. Sohyun suddenly blushed, trying to fix her jeans. Hyuna chuckled seeing her friend's awkwardness. - What were you doing, pervie? - she said with a giggle.
- Let's change the subject, girls - Sohyun stated. Then, seeing the two girls laughing again - It's not what you think... - Hyuna approached at the computer with a smirk - May I check the chronology?

- Fine, I was masturbating, ok? - Sohyun angrily shouted. She didn't noticed Jihyun behind her.

- You was what?


Chapter 11
Hyuna knows


San Josè, United States of America

- Fine, I was masturbating, ok? - Sohyun angrily shouted. She didn't noticed Jihyun behind her.

- You was what? - Jihyun asked in disbelief. She suddenly dropped the clean clothes she was carrying to shout at the younger girl while Hyuna and Sohee were chuckling awkwardly. Sohyun suddenly shivered, hearing Jihyun's voice.

- Ehi, unni, h... h-how's going? - she tried miserably to disguise. Jihyun glanced furiously at the younger girl when the latter tried to change the subject while trying to pick up the fallen clothes. - Erm... yes... fine Jihyun, I was... erm... masturbating?

- Oh lord Jesus, how many times I should repeat that? - Sohyun blushed violently, remembering the last time she was caught by Jihyun - I don't feel very good Sohyun, for your luck... just go and have fun with your friends.

Sohyun started questioningly at her unni, disbelieving at her statement. - What do you want? - she blurted, holding back a laugh. - I've been sixteen too - she finally told, without being able to hold back the laughter anymore. - I caught Hyun-ah a lot of times too... - she laughed.

- If you say so... - Sohyun and Sohee both looked at the red-haired girl whom suddenly came out of the room. - Let's go girls, we have a dinner... - she finally shouted happily.

(later...)

The  restaurant welcomed the three girls with its warmth, allowing the latters to thaw out their hands. Surprisingly the weather was really cold even in California, which is usually sunny due the tropical climate.

Sohee sat in front of the two other girls, whom sat on the leather sofa. When they finally settled, Hyuna placed her head on Sohyun's lap, as she always do, until she noticed Sohee's questioning glare. You're weird, Hyuna, you exactly act like a lesbian, Sohee thought. On the other hand, Sohyun seemed to be upset when Hyuna suddenly stood up from that position. - Any problems?

- Don't bother about that - Hyuna said with a blush. Sohee was still hiddenly eyeing her friend, thus making the ambience a little awkward.

- Ain't that girl Rebecca Jackson, that stupid journalist whom is always chasing Jiyoon? - Sohyun hinted at a blond girl whom was taking a seat at her table, along with a korean girl. Hyuna and Sohee turned slowly their head towards the table without being showy.

- Yes, and she is Choi Sooyoung - Sohee stared at Hyuna whom returned the gaze, worried. - She is going to debut with the SNSD this february. The one with serious psycological problems, right Hyuna? - she joked bitterly. Once more time Sohyun was not understanding their speech, but she also didn't care.

Mountain View, United States of America

- And so you slept with Gayoon to gather informations? - Sooyoung worriedly asked. I thought you were cheating on me, I'm so sorry Becky please forgive me. I've been so selfish and I also shouted at you... and I also pretended that you was wrong. Sorry.

Sooyoung's thoughts was flowing quickly into her mind, but she didn't manage to express them. All that she managed to mutter is just an unconvinced "sorry", though her eyes was revealing her sadness. Rebecca understood at any rate.

- Look at me, Sooyoung... I was wrong, not you. Who would love a stupid nosy journalist whom sleep with other girls to gather informations? It's really bastard. You was right when you left me alone... - Rebecca stopped to talk for a bunch of seconds. - ...but I couldn't leave you right now... you need more attention and I still care about you... I still love you... - Sooyoung smiled - put on your coat...

...I'll take you to dinner - Rebecca replied at her questioning gaze. Though I am a bad girlfriend I still can be a good friend... I wish I will be able to forgive myself, sometime.

She could feel Sooyoung's warmth when the younger girl hugged her and mixture of feelings invaded her heart. First, love... she could feel she was afraid to lose her... second, guilt... she regretted to have become a journalist, since this sometimes may hurt other people. The last, sadness... She also thought about being in love with such a problematic girl. I will take care of you, Sooyoung...

- Are you Ok, Becky? - Sooyoung suddenly broke off her toughts, seeing her blank stare. - You look tired...

(later...)

Rebecca was staring at the two red-haired girl whom were sitting some tables far from them... - What are you looking at, Becky - Sooyoung stated, trying to recognize what the older girl was looking for.

- They are Hyuna and Sohyun... Jiyoon's groupmates... - she muttered. Sooyoung recognized Sohee when she looked at the two other girls, though she was not understanding the problem.

- Hyuna knows about me sleeping with Gayoon... - she revealed.


Chapter 12
Feeling guilty


- Hyuna knows about me sleeping with Gayoon.... - Rebecca frowned.

17 Days earlier

On the stage, the dark-haired young girl opened a package and took off a bouquet along with a sapphire ring. Jiyoon knelt in front of Amber.

- Amber Josephine Liu, I love you, and I won't hide our relationship... do you love me? - Amber blushed violently. Astonished she nodded and babbled - Yes, I do. - the crowd hailed the couple.

Rebecca was staring surprisingly at Jiyoon. What was that farce supposed to be? Jiyoon should confess about the drug payload. Was she trying to cover her crime with a stupid love scene?

Rececca kept to stare at the stage, shocked by the recent events. Her eyes met those of Gayoon, who was... feeling guilty? She must have been blind, it's some kind of reflection of light. But when Gayoon noticed her stare, she winked.

And yet, the more she kept staring the girl, the more she convinced herself that she knows something. She should investigate. When the crowd dissolved, she went towards Jiyoon, trying to interview her... but something... or someone blocked her.

- Ehi babe, were you looking for me? - Rebecca shivered, surprised by the presence of Gayoon behind her. Did she just try to flirt with her? This was surely going to be a mess

- I feel horny, my little journalist - she whispered. - Why don't we go on my place?  I'd like to... interview you... - she said seductively. Interview her... seriously? it is the worst seductive joke ever. But still, she should investigate about Jiyoon, she should do it...

...Don't even think about that, you love Sooyoung, Rebecca, you can't just sleep with a girl to... investigate. Rebecca was fighting with herself, divided between work and love. She knew what she would choose.

- Mhh... - she smirked. - you seem a naughty girl, aren't you going to rape me? - she bit her glasses, holding the game to the sandy-haired girl, who exulted mentally and grabbed Rebecca's waist. She pulled the journalist unto her car, and got into it.

While Gayoon was driving Rebecca couldn't help but stare at her new sex partner. Although she was aroused she couldn't help but feel her soul dirty. Her body was begging for a sexual life, the sexual life that she can't gain with Sooyoung, while her brain was telling her to don't do anything stupid... as always happens with humans, the body won.

Gayoon parked the car and got out from the latter. She almost lifted Rebecca with her strongness. She was eager, eager to taste that american girl who turns her on so badly. She was eager to eat her...

In the 4Minute's house, nobody could be found. Gayoon carried Rebecca unto her bedroom, the bedroom that she share with Jiyoon, as a little cute sign tell. Crap, that's Jiyoon bedroom, I seriously went all the way... Rebecca thought. But there was no time to think...

Gayoon stripped Rebecca from her neckwarmer until her panties. She was licking her own lips, seductively. She was wrong, Gayoon knew how to turn her on... Rebecca was sincerely aroused, and she felt her body really wet, since Gayoon was starting to touch her.

Gayoon slid a finger onto her naked body, outlining her features perfectly, until her finger arrived near her private parts. She inserted two fingers directly to attain a loud moad from the american girl.

The blond beauty was on the top of Rebecca, teasing her with her fingers, exciting the journalist whom was shaking convulsively her body, trying to control herself and not to come too early.

She was moaning uncontrolled, while Gayoon hadn't yet started. - So amenable? I didn't even began, little horny journalist... you are going to scream my name, to pray me to fuck you... what's my name? - she teased. - What's my name, Rebecca Jackson? - She stucked another finger into her.

- Heo Gayoooooon... please, I beg you, fuck me!! - she shouted so loudly that a bird near the window ran away, scared. Rebecca saw her wildest dreams come true.

Gayoon, once achieved what she was looking for, jumped on the top of the shorter girl and pressed her pussy against that of Rebecca, stimulating violently her clit, and gaining more screams from her. She was shaking forcibly her body, alternating sinuous movements to violent movements.

The blond girl was enjoying the warmth of Rebecca's body, while fucking her with strenght. She was even whispering her dirty thought at her ear, though she couldn't hear them, being busy at screaming like a dolphin and shaking her body, being closer and closer at her climax.

She didn't manage to contain her excitement anymore. Rebecca screamed like a mad when she came, wetting the bed. Gayoon came too, at the same moment as her, moaning for the pleasure.

After cuddling for a while, Rebecca looked at her clock and sighed hurtfully... - I must go, I am really late... - Gayoon wore a peignoir to see out her... - Anyway... uhm... it has been really nice... Will we see each other again? - she smiled. The other one nodded.

Gayoon led her unto the door, at the same moment when a girl opened the door from the outside. Hyuna glanced surprised at Gayoon, whom was shocked. She just managed to say - Do not tell anyone...


Chapter 13
Addiction


South Korea, 2008

- It hurts, it hurts a lot. Even without this cut, my life hurts and I don't want to feel the pain... When I go sleep I feel only shame and regrets... - Gayoon didn't manage to keep her tears anymore... they started to flow while she was staring blankly at Jiyoon, eaten by her memories.

A whole life of pain... Jiyoon thought, and sat near her to comfort the daring hero.

- I don't want to judge you, Gayoon... but I will make you stop... you have me now... forget about your sister, forget about your previous life... things can always change.

Gayoon cried even loudly when Jiyoon mentioned her sister. - She raped me, Jiyoon... when I was only thirteen... I... How I can bear with this... life - the blond girl stopped, feeling weak.

The painkillers circulating in the blood prevailed once more time against her body, preventing her from moving... There's a moment, when you mix analgesics with tranquillizers called "the death of the senses". The body is weak due the effect  of freezing obtained with the tranquillizers and meanwhile the brain is unable to find the cause, being sedated...

- Gayoon! Gayoon wake up - Jiyoon placed her left hand on her wrist, looking for the heartbeat. - Gayoon please don't die... I don't want to lose you... I... love you. Don't leave me alone...

She visibly shivered, again and again while crying loudly. This can't be, she can't be dead...

- What the fuck is... - Hye-jin burst into the room but once seen the blond girl lying onto Jiyoon's bed she stopped. She looked worriedly at Jiyoon who didn't seem to notice the older girl. - What the fuck is happened? - she repeated louder to make Jiyoon listen her.

Jiyoon didn't manage to utter a word, and Hye-jin approached at the younger girl to check her wrist. Mumbling some kind of insults to the institutions, suddenly carried Gayoon onto her shoulders.

Jiyoon gazed the older girl questioningly. - That stupid bitch is alive - she began - she's just an irresponsible reckless slut... - the woman cursed loudly. Jiyoon followed her unto the sickbay, just to found the latter empty.

- There's not doctor here, what should we do? - she cried. Hye-jin sighed like a mother when her child doesn't want to shower. - Obviously there's nobody around here, or else I couldn't filch any syringe... now. I need a little bit of lint and a dose of antianalgesic. Do the good girl and grab one of these yellow vials in that locker...

Jiyoon obeyed at her and went to grab the lint together with the antianalgesic. Hye-jin injected the whitish fluid into Gayoon's arm and covered the cut with the sterile drape.

Slowly, the wrist began to pump blood, allowing Jiyoon to sigh in relief. - Gayoon... you are alive. - she whispered under her breath. The younger girl suddenly hugged Hye-jin, whom suprised by her acts hugged back the poor girl. Long time she didn't receive a sing of affection. Thanks...

- Listen to me, beauty - Hye-jin seriously stared at the younger girl. - Gayoon has taken drugs, I just stole medicines from the sickbay and you're just too pretty to not be targeted... they will notice the theft sooner or later. You must convince Gayoon to spill out the dealer's name. It is the only way to save her. I will assume the blame for the theft. Understood?

Jiyoon nodded quietly, trying to keep in mind her tasks. - Thanks, Hye-jin unni... - she managed to say.

Some noises were heard from the stairs... - Lieutenant, we must bring her at the sickbay, I think she has an heart attack - Two women were carrying a girl up the stairs. Hye-jin pulled Jiyoon and Gayoon's body into the lumber room, to hide themselves.

The lieutenant together with another woman, dressed as a nurse, carried the girl unto the cot. Hye-jin looked from her hiding place towards the little girl to find out what she feared. Min-ji...

- Gyeon Minji, fifteen years old, Second district... under observation since she was five due cardiovascular problems, renal failure and... Mediterranean anaemia. - the nurse explained while the lieutenant was nervously walking back and forth around the room. - Life time left... 2 years.

- Noooo! - Hye-jin burst out from the lumber room, and hugged the poor girl. - Jeung... what the fuck are you supposed to do here? - the lieutenant shouted at the girl, whom didn't pay attention.

- Shut the fuck up... this can't be... this can't be. She didn't say nothing. I love her....

Jiyoon was hearing the conversation from the lumber room, and suddenly everything matched. She was seen with a fifteen, and everybody thinks she is a crazy pedophile...

Hye-jin loves her.


Chapter 14
Sohyun... help me!


San Josè, United States of America

The clinking of the glasses was filling the air in the restaurant. Voices, laughters from the other people were surrounding Hyuna's thoughts. She was leaned against the table with the elbow.

- Yes, and she is Choi Sooyoung - Sohee recognized the taller girl - She is going to debut with the SNSD this february. The one with serious psycological problems, right Hyuna? - Sohee laughed, toying with her glass.

- What are you talking about, Sohee? - Sohyun questioningly gazed at her. - What kind of psycological problems are you talking about? - she asked worriedly. She didn't knew about their conversation.

- I don't know, ask Hyuna. I thought she was just a pervert but Hyuna insisted that she has some kind of sickness... so, Hyuna, can you explain us? - she turned her head towards Hyuna, whom stood up suddenly with a blank stare.

- I need to go to the bathroom - she stated, bitterly. Sohyun stood up to accompany, but Hyuna shook her head. - Don't follow me, Sohyun, I need to be alone.

Sohyun worried looked at her friend. Should I follow her? she thought. She looked back at Sohee whom was sipping her Coca Cola and sighed loudly. - What should I do with you two?! 

Sohee shrugged. - This doesn't help so much! - she shouted. Then the young girl followed Hyuna into the bathroom. Passing close to Rebecca and Sooyoung, she noticed Rebecca's stare. Are you following me, huh? I don't know where Jiyoon is, stupid bitch. Pray I don't find you putting your hands into her stuff or else I will beat you up.

She passed out her table, glancing at the journalist. I should focus on Hyuna right now, she is going to make something stupid. I wonder what was Sohee talking about... does Hyuna know that girl?

Lost into her thoughts, she reached the bathroom. Hyuna was crying loudly, until Sohyun hugged her, to make her stop. - What happened, Hyun? What are you crying about?

The red-haired girl didn't manage to say in an understandable korean what she wanted to say. Sohyun hugged tighter the girl to make her stop crying for the first, and allow her to talk...

- Sohyun... help me... Amber... Jiyoon... - she cried.

1 Hours earlier, 4Minute's Home

Jiyoon, Gayoon and Jihyun were playing poker at home, laying on the armchairs. Without the underages around, they managed to have a break, finally, from the work after a couple of months.

With the new year approaching, they were enjoying after a long time their holydays. Jiyoon was laughing as she had never done, playing cards with her two friends. Problems and worries were slipped away, letting her to have fun.

- You're bluffing, Jihyun - Gayoon laughed, teasing the poor girl whom didn't seem to refrain from laughing like a fool. - You're not so good at poker, are you? - the blond girl teased more.

- Oh damn, you're right, I am just incapable at this game - she shouted in the grip of laughter. - We should have played a board game, you know? - she added. Having drunk a little bit, the three girls were just showing a stupid grin on their face.

- Shouldn't we bring back Hyuna and Sohyun? - Jiyoon said - If we stay here more, I think I will lose my lucidity... - she laughed - I have a girlfriend, guys, I can't take risks.

Both Gayoon and Jihyun laughed. Gayoon even put an arm around Jihyun's neck with sensuality, laughing like a monkey. - Tonight I will make you become gay, Jihyun - she giggled.

- Go away, byuntae! - she shouted disgusted, but still laughing for the awkward statement. - oh damn, I live with two lesbians. Three, if we count also Hyuna, right? - she shouted. Jiyoon and Gayoon looked at the leader, with a weird look. Jihyun realised her error and tried to hide her statement quickly. Luckily the two other girls were drunk too.

- Huh, forget about it, I'm being random. The wine is making me shoot crap! - she added. - Weren't we going to bring back the maknaes, guys? It's already late. What was the restaurant's name, Gayoon?

- Fahrenheit Ultra Lounge, in San Fernando street. - she said. Jiyoon looked surprised - What a coincidence! Amber is there too. We have to go in only one place. Lucky we are! - she shouted. - Who drive?

- Me - Jihyun and Gayoon shouted at the same time. They looked the each other. - Rock, paper and scissors? - Jihyun asked. - One match. - Gayoon accepted and looked at the other girl.

- Scissors cut your freakin' paper, I won! - Jihyun exulted like a kid. - But hey, we are all drunk, we shouldn't drive, ain't so? - she asked. - We are drunk, we can't know that it's wrong driving when we are drunk. Because we a drunk - Gayoon shouted.

Jihyun shrugged and got into the car.


Chapter 15
Without telling me


4Minute's house, driveway

Gayoon laughed joyfully at Jihyun's statement. - We are drunk, we can't know that it's wrong driving when we are drunk... Because we are drunk - Gayoon yelled at the leader.

Jihyun shrugged and got into the car. - It can not be faulted! So let's go girls, we need to hurry. It is late already! - she shouted.

The moon was at the end of the lunar cycle, and it was brightly shining in the middle of the sky, allowing them to see clearly without any light. Jihyun started the engine and pressed on the pedal to accelerate.

Gayoon rested her head onto her lap - Gayoon! - she whined, while pouting... - I need to look at the way, don't ever try to flirt with me when I'm driving a car, especially if we are both drunk... - she yelled. Don't try to flirt with me even if I'm not driving, she thought without saying it aloud.

- What a drag! Stop being so logic, you are drunk for God's sake... Plus you look wonderful with your new haircut... - she looked up towards Jihyun. The latter was surprised, but shrugged.

Jiyoon on the other hand was still closed into her thoughts, until Gayoon spoke. Suddely something hit her forebrain... Does Gayoon like Jihyun? Maybe she's just drunk... she thought. But hey, I have seen her drunk previously and she never tried to approach with anybody...

Synapses started to accelerate, confusing her. Gayoon! How dare you to be in love without telling me? huh?

- Do you think so? - Jihyun asked.

- Yeah, short hair are cute... I love the red meshing as well, it looks good on you... (Click)

Jiyoon glanced at the blond girl from the back seat, until Gayoon noticed the strange gaze. What do you want? She silently asked. Jiyoon smirked and didn't reply, although she wanted to scream the fact. You like her, Gayoonie!.

The day after, Amber's house

As always, in San Josè the sun was setting in the late afternoon, together with a light drizzle. A black car was parking near the big flat exactly when the clock on the dashboard marked the 6 p.m.

A dark-haired asian girl got off the car from the passenger seat and came into the flat. Meanwhile, the driver started the engine again, turned the corner and disappeared at the sight.

The girl climbed the stairs, until she reached the third floor, and knocked at the second door on the left. The girl looked really angry when nobody went to open the door, and knocked louder, shouting.

- Amber, I know you're here, don't try to hide from me... I have seen the lights on. - Victoria yelled. - I give you ten seconds, then I will throw down the door, I warn you.

Nobody answered. - Well, you don't give me any chance... Ten... nine... eight... - the girl clenched her fists, ready to throw down the door, but still hoping that someone will open the door. - seven... six... five... - ...she was counting slower and slower. - four... three...

Suddenly, the door opened allowing Victoria to see inside the house. A short blond-haired girl was standing in front of her with a sad look, staring at the older girl with fear, as if she would break her instead of the door.

- Sun-young... what... what are you doing here? - she asked.

Luna kept staring at Victoria, trying to find the words to describe the situation. - I live here, unni... - a tear started to flow from her eye - ...the householder kicked me out from my flat. Amber is...

- Ehi, ehi. Don't cry. What happened? - the older girl worriedly asked to Luna, whom hugged her leader tightly to vent anger through the tears.

- He found out that I was underage... - she weakly stated. Victoria nodded. - please, unni, forgive me. It's not Amber's fault, it's mine. I... it's the first time I have a crush, unni, and I didn't... I didn't expect to crush for a girl. I was just confused.

- It's ok, Sun-young. It's not even your fault... I should have talked to you about these things long time ago... However now you should tell me where Amber is. I won't kill her, I promise, but I need her here... if all will be fine, we will record a demo... and maybe I will manage to sign a contract.

- Amber is not here anymore, unni. I'm really sorry if I didn't tell you. - Victoria stared at the younger girl.

- What does "not here" mean, Sun? - She already know the answer, tough she don't want to hear it. She kept staring at the younger girl whom was looking down, sighing.

- She is in back Thailandia, unni.


Chapter 16
The truth


Present time, San Josè, United States

Is late night in San Josè, but the streets are full of people and the lights still shine on the road. Jiyoon was dumbly grinning like a idiot in the back seat, staring at the wonderful city and mulling about Gayoon.

The latter, due the large amount of alchool drunk previously, was leaning her head against the driver's lap, asleep. Finally, Jihyun was silently driving towards San Fernando street.

Though Jiyoon and Jihyun were thinking different things, both of them was thinking at the same person...

- Jihyun...?

Jiyoon asked with a soft voice to do not wake up the sleeping girl. Gayoon murmured something in her sleep, but she didn't  wake up. - How do you manage to keep Gayoon quiet? - she joked.

Jihyun bitterly thought about the question, knowing the correct answer but still afraid to tell it aloud. Because she loves me, of course, she thought without any shilly-shally.

- Because I am an authoritative leader, I guess... - she said.

Jiyoon looked very disappointed at her cold reply, though she didn't expect anything else. - Did you notice something else, Jihyun? - she stated. This time Jiyoon angrily underlined her words, to force the older girl to talk about the real problem.

- Jiyoon... I perfectly know what you mean, but I wouldn't. Shove this information into your precious head, will you? I'm not gay and I will never be. Don't think I am homophobic but I am really tired of your trend to think that anybody in this world is gay. I am not. Understood?

Gayoon finally woke up, hearing the loud voices into the car. - What happened? Why do you two need to shout so loud, huh...? - she groaned. Forthwith Jihyun blushed and Jiyoon tried to find something to say.

- Jihyun said that I was cheating earlier... at poker... - she lied shamelessly. Jihyun nodded unconvincedly and looked at the blond girl whom was still leaning her head onto her private. She looked comfortable too...

- Well, you should get up, we arrived... - she softly asked to Gayoon. The latter shrugged and got up from that position. - Thanks...

They got off the car. A crowded street surround the environment. Busy people, drunk teenagers, couples and many other kinds of lives are walking around in San Fernando street, making the three korean girls smile, seeing the freedom inside their heart.

- Ain't that wonderful? - Jiyoon said, admiring the city in its wideness. Jihyun seemed in a hurry. - Yes, it is, but let's go now, okay? - she blurted.

Gayoon was looking inside a showcase while a young man approached at her, trying to talk with the girl. He had brownish hair, and hazel eyes, with a slight beard - Excuse me, can I have some information about this way, I don't know how to reach the Fahrenhait club, do you now where is it?

Gayoon tried to babble something intelligible - Eshcuse me, wait a shecond... - she switched to korean - JIYOON, this guy is talking me in english, help me.

Jihyun interposed herself from Jiyoon ang Gayoon. - I have the best english knowledge around here. Ain't so...? Excuse my friend, mister, she doesn't want to learn english, she's a little bit stubborn... The Fahrenait Ultra Lounge is not far from here, and we are going there too. Can we lead you?

- I'd like to, but I'm waiting for my sister here, and I should go alone... - he said.

Jihyun took off a paper map from her bag, and wrote something with a black pen on the latter and then she gave that paper at the man. - Take the map, I don't need it, we've been living here since a long... - she smiled.

Jiyoon stared shocked at Jihyun, and gave a nudge to Gayoon. - Didn't you notice? - Jiyoon hinted at Jihyun whom was smiling at the young man. - She wrote her phone number on the map...

Gayoon suddenly frowned. - Did she really do? - She frowned deeper seeing Jiyoon's nod.

- Let's go guys, Hyuna and Sohyun must be waiting for us, ain't so? Plus I want to see if Daniel managed to find the place. - Jiyoon shot a glare at Jihyun... Daniel, you must be kidding me... - Yes, she asked my name so I told him and he said his name to me... - she smiled childishly. Oh shit...

The three girl went towards the restaurant until they reached it. They went inside, searching for the younger girl, but they didn't manage to find them until a sweet voice called Jihyun. - Jihyun unni...?

Sohee was sitting on a table, alone near two empty chairs. - Are you looking for Hyuna and Sohyun... they are in the bathroom... I think Hyuna is sick. - she told the others.

Jihyun, Gayoon and Jiyoon went towards the bathroom, to see what was happening, but the most awkward scene was waiting for them.

Inside the ladies bathroom, Hyuna was crying hugging Sohyun while she was shouting towards Amber. Luna was sitting in the corner upset, while Rebecca and Sooyoung were awkwardly trying to understand.

...Gayoon looked at Rebecca...

...Jiyoon looked at Amber...

...Hyuna looked at Jiyoon...

Gayoon tried to hide herself, while Sohyun was staring at Jiyoon, trying to explain the situation. - Unni... Hyuna... - She stopped, trying to be gentle, though Jiyoon already knew what it was happening. Finally, Hyuna let out the fact.

- Amber was kissing Sun-young...

A/N: 1) Sun-young is Luna, the characters never call her with her stage name. 2) I usually write thoughts in italic, but I also have to use italic when they switch language in their direct speech, such as when they talk in english in this chapter.


Chapter 17
Extracurricular courses


South Korea, 2008

- I would like to clear things up with you, Gayoon... - the short haired girl whispered. The sandy-haired girl had approached at her shoulder, trying to lean her head against the younger girl's one, while the bus was bouncing at every hole in the road surface.

As soon as Jiyoon rejected the contact, Gayoon got disappointed. The short girl faced her, trying to comfort the latter - ...since we've met, I needed someone to help me, and you ended up having too much skinship with me and even thinking that I love you... - she continued.

Gayoon was calmly looking out the window, listening to the younger girl... - I'm scared of that, Gayoon...

- I really like you, believe me... but there's no way to be together with you, there's no way I could feel something... - she stopped to look directly into her eyes. - ...sexually. - she said, lowering her voice.

Gayoon turned her head towards the younger girl, and caressed her features slowly. - I know. Yeah, don't look me with that face - she pouted - I think your friendship is more important than your body for me...

Jiyoon smiled shyly - ...but I still want to hug me, babygirl... - she bitterly laughed, trying to smile towards the other one.

After a while, the bus stopped to let them get off. Outside of the school, no building could be seen, except for the small place, where the extracurricular courses are performed. It is located about 10 kilometers far from the school jurisdiction.

Inside the atrium a squallid environment was filling the place. A strong tall man received the group of students together with a young dark-haired girl. The man looked american, and the girl was korean, but her clothes hinted that she lived in the States for many years.

She was really feminine, though she was wearing a male t-shirt along with Jeans, but Jiyoon already saw american girls previously, and she knew that they usually wear male clothes.

On the other hand, Gayoon was staring at her with a strange gaze, trying to understand her strange look. She was also smiling, like she did only once in her life, when she met Jiyoon for the first time.

- Stop staring at her, in America the girls like men... - Jiyoon whispered.

- I thought the America was a free place, babygirl... - she blurted. Somehow, she was smiling. - You know? I though that americans wore shiny clothes with... starlets, glitter and... - she laughed - ...but she is not so, she even wear male clothes.

- Those are not male clothes, the girls usually wear them... that is freedom! But gay people are hated in the same way as here... look at her, Gayoonie. - Gayoon looked towards the dark-haired girl, whom was writing something into her little notebook.

- She is straight, from the top to the bottom. Who would sit there, staring at her stupid diary, when you have a whole class of women in uniform to stare... - Gayoon frowned, realising that she was right.

- I'd better give up. Anyway... dreaming doesn't cost, and masturbating neither... - she winked. Jiyoon grinned towards her naughty friend.

The strong tall man whispered something at her assistent's ear, and nodded. Then, he recalled the silence in the large room.

The day after, 11:00 a.m.

The sunlight was filling the dorm, as always. There were no windows, and so the morning lights woke up the girls in the bedroom, except for Hye-jin as her bed was empty... Gayoon covered her own face with a pillow and groaned, babbling something.

She put on her pants and she stretched as always, yawning loudly. Jiyoon sat onto her bed while she was settling the hairpin with a smile. When, she finished, she turned her head towards Gayoon.

- Had a good sleep, honey? - she joked, winking at the other girl. Gayoon yawned again, but grinned at her comment. - I know you had... your dreams were loud last night. You stuttered all the night about the dark-haired girl...

- You know me too well... but I will forget about her in a week or two... I guess - she put the tongue out. - it's just a slight crush, I don't even know her name, and she will be back in the States soon...

- Jihyun... her name is Jihyun, she said that yesterday but you were busy staring at her boobs, I see... - Jiyoon teased Gayoon, but the latter shrugged as she can't deny.

The two girl dressed up and walked toward the canteen to have breakfast. It was really cold, as always though the sky was sunny. That's good for us... no more training session under the rain... Jiyoon thought.

When they turned the corner Hye-jin stopped them and gave them a worried look - the lieutenant found out that you two were in the sickbay and you took drugs. You must live, tonight... and you will bring Minji with you.


Chapter 18
Leaving with secrets


Storage room, one hour later

The room was empty, except for some shelves and a lot of books stacked randomly around, in the center of the room or at the edges. The place was really dusty, as if nobody didn't clean it for years (That is not so untrue).

Hye-jin leaned her body against the dirty wall, while Gayoon was staning up, looking questioningly at the older girl, and still thinking about what she said an hour ago.

She never even thinked about leaving. No so many times, at least. She always thinked at her school such as a place in which she would have grown for ever. She didn't neither thinked about the war. Is there a war, for real?

But now Hye-jin was thoughtfully staring at her, thinking about the words she will say to Gayoon...

- The lieutenant know about your stunt... it's too late to do anything. Corrupt her... be a sex slave... even kill her. There's nothing you can do. She frisked your room, and she found all your shit... by the way, it's really wretched putting out to Ji-young to have half-priced painkillers. Did you enjoy...?

Gayoon blushed... - ...but I'm not here for this. I hate your shit face with all my strenght, but I think that I'm fond with that short-haired girl since the first time that I saw her in underwear. So... good for you, I wish you the best luck...

...this evening, the american shitty singer and her freaking music teacher are going back to shittiland. You will beg them to bring you and Jiyoon. You will tell them that you two are lost having no food.

- What if she remember about us?

- Of course she will. But she will not tell anything... Now let's talk about serious stuff. Ji-young told me that she need a service, and you will do it... you will bring with you some drugs... mainly analgesics...

- What? Me? A dealer... I wish you are kidding. I can't do it...

- You can do it, Gayoon. It's too simple... you have typical symptoms of the mentally unstable person... well, because you are. In the States, analgesics for personal use are legal, and there's no way to check where you are coming from. Technically you deserve political asylum because of the war between Afghanistan and Korea. So they couldn't deny you to relieve your atavistic pain, you poor girl...

- I don't even ever saw a battlefield...

- Yeah, but they don't know. Remember... you aren't doing anything outlaw. Technically, this is also true. Since you are not really a soldier, but just a filthy student with too much libido, you wouldn't deserve any asylum... But unless they find out this, you are perfectly doing it lawful... bring your training uniform, ok?

Gayoon nervously started to walk around, stopping occasionally. - I'm not fully convinced, Hye... Does Jiyoon know something?

- She doesn't. She won't suspect anything, and even if she will suspect, tell her the same excuse that you will use once arrived in the States: they are for personal use, because you're a poor tapped underage soldier, ok? - she said with scornful mordacity.

- Dying is not a choice, Gayoon, ok...?

- What about Min-ji, why is she coming with us, huh? You shag her, don't you? I won't change diapers to a fifteen years old bitch because you want to take care occasionally of someone. I'm an addict, not a fool, remember...

Hye-jin violently grabbed her hairs and threw her body against the wall with unnatural strenght. - Do you want to know? Yes, I do shag her... and, surprise! I have feelings too, and I love her so fucking...

She stopped for a while, while Gayoon was staring at her with a mix of fear and shame. Does she really love her so much?

The older girl breathed to say something, calmly. - Do you want to know why is she coming with you? She suffer from Anemia... and she has only 2 precious years of life before dying... but who cares? If she stay here, she will die...

...Do you even know what I'm feeling just now? Do you believe it's simple to just let the person you love go? huh?

- No, I don't, Hye-jin, I don't.

- Enjoy your life, Gayoon... I mean, you still have a chance to live with the person you love, ain't so? I will never see Min-ji again, and this might kill me in the future. But I prefer dying and give her the possibility to live instead of leaving her die and live myself. Do you understand?

- Why are you saying that, Hye? Why do you think that I am in love, have I ever told you this? - Gayoon blurted with anger, even if already knew that the older girl was right.

Hye-jin came out of the room with a deep smile. - Yeah, you can deny, if you like so... but I know that you love Jiyoon, and this will not change. Ever.


Chapter 19
The puzzle


San Josè, United States, 2010

Rebecca was staring at her clock nervously, eager to reach the end of the night, when Sohyun passed near her with a scornful look. She had an air of challenge when she met the girl's gaze.

A thought made its way into her head: she know everything. Find all the piece of the puzzle was impossible, but she had enough informations to say that Jiyoon already knew to be tailed.

So Hyuna knows that I slept with Gayoon, and Sohyun know that I'm following her. What else? she thought.

While she was tidying up her thoughts, Sooyoung called her. - Becky, you won't believe your own sight, but Gayoon have just come in... - she whispered, making Rebecca to turn slowly her her towards the entrance. It was true, the three girls were walking into the place.

She babbled an insult towards God... - I go to the bathroom, I can't be found here, not now and not when Sohyun have just found out that I'm tailing Jiyoon. Gayoon will beat the shit out of me, I know...

Sooyoung followed the older girl, even if the latter was begging her to stay at the table. Meanwhile Gayoon along with Jiyoon and Jihyun was walking towards Hyuna and Sohyun's table. The short girl had recognized Jihyun and was calling her.

Rebecca suddenly ran in the bathroom, avoiding Gayoon. When she came in, a loud voice was creaming her lungs out of the chest towards another girl. Ain't that Sohyun's voice...?

Sohyun was screaming to Amber while Hyuna and another little girl was crying, in the opposite corner of the room... The unknown girl was sitting on the floor.

- You little filthy poisonous bitch! How do you dare to cheat on Jiyoon with this fucking dumbass face? In a public place? - Sohyun shouted toward the other girl. Yes, it is Sohyun's voice, and this is clearly Jiyoon's girlfriend... I might need to run away, now.

Sooyoung had followed her, and was questioningly staring at the fight. In that moment Gayoon, Jihyun and Jiyoon burst into the bathroom, making the silent inside the place.

After the awkward moment, after Hyuna had explained the situation, Jiyoon ran away, followed by Amber. She heard the tears flowing, while she stayed still. Only Jihyun, Sooyoung and Gayoon didn't leave the room...

- Sooyoung... please, go into my car. I will arrive soon... - she weakly whispered, while Gayoon was staring at her with visible anger.

Rebecca stared at her with fear, though Gayoon was as weak as her and tears was flowing onto her cheeks too... - So I was just another way to follow her, ain't so, Rebecca?

Jihyun looked worriedly at Gayoon, not understanding the latter. - I gave you the most precious thing I have, and it was all just to follow Jiyoon? She didn't make anything, you know? Stop stalking her or I will kick your ass into a prison, understood?

Rebecca ran away, crying while Jihyun kept staring shocked at her friend... - You...?

Gayoon's cheeks were definitively covered with tears, when she hugged her best friend. - Slept with her? Yeah, yes, I did and it was the most stupid freaking mistake that I ever did, Jihyun. Because it is me... it is me that she's looking for...

- What do you mean? - she said, busy at drying her tears.

- When I and Jiyoon fled from the school... when you saved us.. well, I was dealing a payload of analgesics. It was the price for the freedom. Rebecca is following Jiyoon...

...but she is looking for me.

Meanwhile, out of the restaurant

- Jiyoon... Jiyoon please wait I can explain you. Stop, please! - she shouted towards the crying girl, whom already picked the car's keys and was opening the door.

- What would you explain, Amber, if I let you talk? That it was all a mistake? That you love me with all your strenght? I wouldn't believe, don't waste your breath, there's no need.

Amber wiped a tear from the cheeks, resignedly. - What did you tell me during out first date, Jiyoon, what did you tell? - she babbled.

Jiyoon glared at her ex-girlfriend with scornful hatred. - They were only empty words of love to bring you to bed... I don't care what I said, I don't love you anymore. I beared with your selfishness only because I needed someone on my side... and what I got? Two years of suffering and a cheater...

Jiyoon started the engine, not even thinking that she was supposed to bring also Jihyun and Gayoon. Staring at the car, that was disappearing in the corner of the street, Amber silently cried.

In the middle of the street, with the busy people still running back and forth, Amber clenched her fists, angry with herself...

- I was wrong.


Chapter 20
Ellipsis


Airport of Santa Clara County, United States of America, 2008

Nathan Price was a tall and strong man. He was about 40, with short and ordered brown hair that along with the tie and the expensive clothes gave him the classic look of the manager. Graduated in political economy, he started to work as a manager in the entertainment when he was 32.

His actual employer, the red-haired eighteen years old girl Nam Jihyun was staring at him with a grin on her face. - I think I found the perfect girl to write lyrics, Nate...

- Are you talking about one of the three soldiers, Namji...? - he looked straight at her eyes, with the hope that Jihyun will deny, but she just nodded slightly. - I don't know... I don't think this is a good idea... they are rude and...

- Listen to me... I don't like their style so much too, but the blond one is the best vocalist that I ever heard in my life and the other one is good at writing... I bet they will become nicer than now when they will have a job... they are funny, somehow! - she pouted.

- Do you think they are sisters? - he asked with a glare. Jihyun instantly got the meaning of the question, and shook her head. - So...?

Jihyun took her luggage from the roller, and placed it on the ground. - The tall one always call the other 'babygirl'. She's gayer than a rainbow...

- So do you think they are girlfriends? - asked him, with a worried look.

- I don't think that they are together... I mean, Gayoon stare at me all the time! I guess they are just... close friends...?

- Jihyun, listen to me. I have a chance to get a contract from the Cube Entertainment, and I will not sure go and introduce them two addict lesbian soldiers. Do you know what did they found earlier at the checkout? Analgesics... a lot of analgesics! That Gayoon looks like a mentally unstable person... In my honest and personal opinion it would be better if we introduce you as a solo singer...

Jihyun frowned and mumbled... - I suck at writing lyrics, you know that Nate...

- You don't sucks, Jihyun, you just need practise - he said while patting her shoulder with the left hand. Jihyun stared at him with a deep frown, as if she were scolding him.

She buttoned the jacket and started to drag the bag towards the exit. - I already decided, Nate. Tonight I will offer them the work, and they will stay with us at home, is that clear? Be nice with them, they have just lost their home...

- What about the younger one? - he asked.

Jihyun assumed a sad look. - She have a latent form of Anemia... they brought her here to receive medical treatments, or else she will die. Be nice with her too...

- Jihyun, what if... - he began, though he had to stop because the two arrived in the waiting room, where Gayoon and Jiyoon were waiting them. Nathan cursed mentally, and followed his employer.

Slowly, he took his mobile phone from the pocket. While Jihyun was talking with the two girls, he sent a text message. - Jihyun, your mother is already waiting us in the parking... She is with Hyuna.

- Who's Hyuna? - Jiyoon asked, anxiously.

Jihyun smiled and turned towards the short-haired girl. - She is somehow my student. When she was a kid we played a lot together and now I give her music lessons. You will like her, she's very kind...

Jiyoon smiled, reassured by Jihyun's words. When they came out of the airport main building, and turned onto the way for the parking, Jiyoon shrugged into her jacket... it was really cold and a high wind was whistling.

The small group went, by walking, towards the nearest section of the parking, in which a woman in her fourties welcomed them. Jihyun threw herself into her mother's arms, hugging her tightly. A younger girl with red hairs appreared from the back of the car and embraced the older girl too.

They swinged for a couple of seconds, until Jihyun's mother broke the embrace - How are you, Honey!? I thought that you wouldn't have come back anymore...! - the woman shouted with a grin.

- Mom, I would like to present you Gayoon and Jiyoon... they are my new friends and they will stay with me... and the little one is Min-ji, she is about Hyuna's age, I guess...

Ms. Nam waved her hands, and offered to load the bags onto the car. Jiyoon smiled softly and greeted the young red-haired girl, that was shyly hidden behind Ms. Nam's back.

- Hi, cutie, my name is Jiyoon. - she greeted. As Hyuna didn't utter a word, she continued, even later when they got into the car. - and you're Hyuna, I guess... ain't so?

Hyuna smiled, once overcame the shyness. - Yeah... I'm Kim Hyun-ah....

Complexes


San Josè, United States of America, 10 January 2011

The room was sorrounded by old books, a lot of shelfs covered the whole wall and a desk was interposing between her and the psycologist. Jihyun was spitting all her thoughts out, since a need to blow off steam was controlling her.

The frustration along with her most secret and repressed thoughts was being freed and the longer she talked, the more she would have felt well - Relax, Jihyun... you said you would like to tell me about a person. Who's that...?

The girl was crying slightly and some tears fell on her cheeks when she tried to talk again. - I already told you that I live with my bandmates, didn't I? - she carefully started. When the doctor nodded she continued... - Well, since we've been living together, at least with two of them, I have to deal with too much... strange things...

- What do you mean with 'strange things'? - he asked.

Jihyun was nervously toying with the strings of her sweatshirt and she took some time before answering. - It all started when I met them. It was about... November 2008, and I was with my manager in Korea to give music lessons... it was a strange school, some kind of military institute I guess...

- You met two of your bandmates giving lessons in a military school? - he assumed a surprised face.

- Let me finish... One day before I was coming back, I met them... they was clearly students. It looked like they didn't eat for two days and there was a younger girl with them... they told me that this girl was sick, and they begged for food. I know that it was wrong, but I brought them with me... later I gave them a work, since they sang very well... and I gave a work even to the younger girl. She now's fine and works as my assistent...

...but two months ago I found out that Gayoon had problems with drugs previously, and she also took a drug payload when she came in America with me. Now a journalist that works for... some kind of tabloid did a research and found out that she were dealing drugs...

- So... she have problems with the justice?

- No... the journalist mistook them and were following Jiyoon, the other one girl. My lawyer found out that since analgesics are totally lawful here, she didn't do anything wrong... but still she's addicted to painkillers...

...one month ago Gayoon denounced that bitch for stalking and she didn't show her face anymore.

- I can see that all this may stress you. But you will also agree that Gayoon is the first who has a problem, don't you?

Jihyun nodded - I understand, but I haven't finished yet... I mean, when the journalist were following Jiyoon... Gayoon slept with her! I find this creepy, you know? I mean...

- She's gay? - he fixed his position on the chair and kept staring at Jihyun, that nodded with her head.

- ...and so we've arrived at the next problem. Gayoon has always been gay, and also Jiyoon... I'm not homophobic at all, but I'm still worried about their behaviour... if Gayoon see a woman, she will fantasize about her... ever! and she will even say her fantasies aloud...

She stopped to breath, since she was taking too much fast. - I thought that living with two gay women wouldn't have been so much difficult... but I find it increasingly difficult... I mean... when we go out is always in a gay bar or in some other gay place... and I haven't met any men for two years!!

- But when I saw you before the holydays you said you had met a guy, didn't you? - he said.

- Yeah... I met a guy... his name is Daniel. - she smiled.

He wrote something on his pocketbook and looked straight up at her face. - And... are you happy with him? I mean... you know what I actually mean.

Jihyun sighed deeply and look down. - Yes... We have slept together, but I still can't convince myself that I'm happy right now. It's not him... when we talk, I feel that I love everything, his voice, his eyes, everything... but when we have sex, I'm definitively bad...

- You suffer from many inferiority complexes, Jihyun... - he said. - Do you remember the first day you came here? I asked you... 'what brings you in a clinic for diseases of the sexuality?'... and you gave me the right answer! ...you told me 'I have the impression that all things I say or think when it comes to sex aren't real...'

Jihyun smiled - I still think that...

- The first thing you must know to heal is... that the complexes are just complexes... they are precisely not real, they are in your brain and you will be good even in bed if you tell yourself that you can be...

- I know... but living in the land of the rainbow doesn't help. I started to think that... that she likes me. I mean Gayoon.

- What makes you think that? - he curiously asked, scribbling something again on his pocketbook.

- It started all two weeks ago...


Chapter 22
I'm not going to fall apart


San Josè, United States of America, 2010

The day of the winter solstice in San Josè was snowing, even if the sun was still shining in the middle of the sky, drawing a funny landscape. Around the streets, a large crowd of busy people as always was running back and forth.

The christians were buying their christmas presents, and the pagans were exchanging good wishes for the solstice. Everywhere, the people were visibly showing happiness, except for Gayoon.

The blond girl put the headphones in her bag and continued to walk, staring at her feet or looking at the other people. Right in that moment, a woman and two children were laughing, sitting on a bench, but Gayoon couldn't understand what were they saying.

At a quick pace, attained to the little cafè behind the corner, wherein two girls were already waiting for her. Hyuna waved her hand towards Gayoon, taking off her cap of her sweetshirt, though Jihyun didn't even turn her gaze towards the girl.

- What happened? - she worriedly asked. It was not frequent to see Jihyun drinking in a pub and Gayoon with a worried face, aim to scold her. - Well... I might not be the right person to speak about this, but... you shouldn't drink before lunch, it is unhealthy, right?

Jihyun dazedly stared at the other girl, hesitating. - These are bosh that I tell you because you're an alcoholic... I can drink whenever I want... - she rudely replied.

Gayoon shrugged and sat onto the empty chair on Hyuna's left side. - So I guess it would sound bastard if I ask for a beer... - she grinned, earning a giggle from Hyuna. - So, Hyuna, could you tell me what happened, please? - she asked with her best fake honeyed voice.

- Women's stuff... - she pouted. - ...you couldn't understand, sorry!

The blond girl, pretending to be offended, turned on the other side... - I'm kidding, Gay-Gayoonie, I know that you are a girl too. Fine, I will tell you...

- You dared to call me Gay-Gayoonie? Oh... you will pay for this, but later... now I want to know what happened to Jihyun... Tell me the truth or else I will recycle your bones, to make a frame for my photos with them...

- Fine... do you remember that guy that Jihyun met the last week? - Hyuna asked.

- Oh, I see... That one to which Jihyun wrote her number on the map! Oh shit... - Jihyun had ordered another drink and was sipping it slowly, with the head resting onto her elbows.

- Yeah, that one. Basically she's afraid because she want to invite him with us but she doesn't know where to go... - Hyuna continued, with a careful voice, as if she were saying 'pay attention when you talk'.

Gayoon  turned to the dark-haired girl, that had gulped the drink in one sip just a few moments earlier, and was staring at the bar with a blank glare, as if she were trying to remember what she were going to do... - Jiyoon and me are going to the Brix tonight... and I guess Hyuna is coming too, ain't so?

- Yeah, it's fine for me... - Hyuna replied, fixing her red hair.

Jihyun snapped back to reality. - The Brix? Fuck you, Gayoon, it is a gay bar! I have a boyfriend once in a while and you're going to ruin all! Why don't we just go at the Fahrenait for dinner?

Gayoon lowered her voice, just like a kid that beg her mother to give her back a toy that has been taken... - But... I want to... find girls... - she weakly replied, earning once again an amused chuckle from Hyuna.

A few seconds later, a phone rang. Jihyun suddenly grabbed her bag and nervously answered the call. - Oh my god, it's him... Oh, Ah! Hi, Dani, it's me! How are you?

Both Gayoon and Hyuna burst out laughing at her awkwardness, and the older girl signed to them to shut up. While she was walking away, just a few chunks of conversation were being heard - ...Yeah... Oh, surely... I'm sorry for this, but Gayoon insisted... - Gayoon raised an eyebrow at her complaining.

When she finally hanged up, she explained the conversation. - He said... that he's fine with the bar... I guess it's better for me if he won't be able to approach girls, ain't so?

Gayoon ate a nut, and started to munch it, talking with the mouth filled. - Yeah, I guess it's good for me. I will have all the girls for me! - she laughed. - What else did he say?

- Her sister will come too... I've never seen her before, and he want to introduce her to me... - she said. - By the way, close your mouth, you're disgusting... don't look at me in that way.

The blond girl fixed her position on the chair, and licked her lips with fake sensuality. - is this sister hot? - she asked. Jihyun throwed a nut against her friend, scandalized.

- You will never change, Gayoon... - she slapped her own forehead. - Why don't you try to be helpful? Hyuna needs even your help. Tonight she will make her move with Jiyoon...

Hyuna nodded and Gayoon smirked - Once again somebody has fallen in the magical world of the gayness, Jihyunie... you are the next! - she deepened her  smirk, and turned her head towards Jihyun, that made a disgusted face.

- We will see...


Chapter 23
What does she want?


San Josè, United States of America

Gayoon walked into the bar, dragging Hyuna with herself. The red-haired girl groaned shyly, but the older girl just laughed and dragged her hands even stronger than before.

- Gayoon, I don't want to... I will just mess everything up, I'm not ready for this, yet... - she pleaded.

Inside of the Brix, a large crowd of people were already drinking, ever if it was only 10 pm. When Gayoon dragged the younger girl into the bar, a lot of people giggled, making Hyuna blush violently.

- This is your punishment for calling me Gay-Gayoonie. I would forgive you if you said just 'gay', it is a matter of fact, but I can't help with the 'Gayoonie'. You're going to enjoy it anyway... - she chuckled.

Hyuna assumed an unconvinced pout. - I can't do it, Gayoon... I've never had a crush for a girl except for her and I don't know where to start. I have seen it only on television...

Gayoon sighed. - Don't ever trust the television, Hyuna. It's easier than what you could imagine. The wonderful thing about being gay is that you already know what the other one wants... do you understand?

The latter became even more confused... - And what does she wants? - she babbled.

They had just sat when the two other girls arrived. Gayoon waved her hand towards Jihyun and Jiyoon, and she lowered her voice to whisper something at her ear. - When she become drunk... and euphoric... what do you think she will want?

When she finished to say, Jiyoon arrived and hugged both of them. The younger girl shivered, feeling her warm touch, and hugged tightly the other one, whom questioningly stared at her, with a grin. - So... Did you miss me so much? - she giggled.

- Yes, she did - interrupted Gayoon. - So... best wishes to everybody! - she shouted, with a beer in her left hand. She had already corked the bottle and she took a sip.

Jiyoon grinned widely and slapped her arm... - You wouldn't lose a minute... would you?

On the other hand, Jihyun could just sigh and take the beer - You will thank me somehow... hand me that bottle - she bitterly said.

- I thought you wouldn't have started to drink so early, Jihyunie... - she heard a male voice behind her. Surprised, she suddenly turned, and she fronted a brown-haired guy, with the unkempt beard.

The man smiled, while the girl threw herself into his arms... - Dani, you've come! - she screamed with a strange sweet voice. A voice that neither Gayoon nor  Jiyoon nor Hyuna had ever heard.

- Obviously I have... - he whispered. The guy leaned a kiss on the girl's lips, and put down the latter. - and I would like to present you my sister Kylie... she's a bit annoying but you will get used to...

- I heard ya, you know? - a girl behind him said. She had brownish hair like her brother, although longer and without the beard. Also her eyes looked like her brother's. She wore a blue skirt and a colourful sweetshirt that gave her a fancy look... and she was definitively beautiful.

- So... Nice to meet y... - when Gayoon had turned towards the girl, her jaw dropped. She stared at the girl for a few seconds, until she had noticed the strange admiring gaze.

- Does she... talk? - Kaylie asked. Jihyun sighed and slapped Gayoon's head, letting out a groan from her. - We will all get used to the each other... - she said. - Anyway yes, she talk...

- Oh yesh, ehm, I thalk... - she babbled, earning a laughter from Jiyoon and Hyuna.

Gayoon whisperend something about the bathroom, and ran away, making Jihyun sigh deeply again - She's too lazy to study english, but she won't have problems... I'm sure she will understand if you talk to her slowly.

- Oh, I don't mind... I have a korean secretary in my office, and she always mistake the subjunctives... so I'm expert - she laughed.

Daniel came back with four beers, which he put on the table. He turned towards his sister with a questioning gaze. - I thought the new secretary were french... she's called Gabrielle.

- Yeah, her name is french, but she's not. That girl is driving me crazy... today she has spilled coffee on a customer, I would have liked to kill her, but she is very smart and... at least she can make coffee...

 


Chapter 24
How could I be?


In the feet of the green hills, in Mountain View there was an old building. It had been a hospital in the 1980s and it had been restructured several times before it could have become a place for offices.

 

When a blond girl crossed the road to reach the building, the latter could see the rusty gate, that showed how the building has been living for a long time without maintenance.

 

Rebecca put the lipstick into the bag and pulled out a pocket mirror. She eyed her watch fleetingly, and speeded up the pass, as she had noticed how late she were.

 

While she was fixing her hair she pushed a glass door and came into the building. There were only two people inside of the atrium and they both turned their head towards the girl when she came in.

 

One of them wore a graceful clothing, with a black skirt and a cashmere clothing, and she was handing a folder to the other one. Impinging to the stilish professionality of the girl, the other one wore a lemon yellow skirt with a flashy sweatshirt and brownish hair, definitively not matched with the clothes.

 

Rebecca stared for a while at the strange woman, until she decided to address the other one... - Good morning... I'm looking for Kylie Walker, I have an appointment for a job interview. Is she here? - she said with a firm voice.

 

Awaiting a reply from the tall girl, she was surprised by a honeyed dreamy voice - At your disposal Ms. Jackson... - the weird girl said, slightly bowing... - I've been waiting for you for a long time... Cynthia, could you leave us alone? I will be free to talk in a half an hour...

 

Rebecca raised an eyebrow, visibly confused... - You... you are Kylie Walker? - she asked.

 

Kylie smiled at her awkwardness, and waved to follow her in the other room. - Take a seat, Rebecca... I noticed how you stare at my clothes... Don't worry, I'm getting used to... I hope you won't mind if your chief is a twenty years old gay girl that wear indigo skirts...

 

Rebecca shyly shook her head... - Of course not, I mean... I'm... I'm gay too.

 

- I know... That's the reason why I've chosen you, after all... Let's talk about business while this good girl brings us a coffee... - she called loudly a person that Rebecca couldn't see, being on shoulders.

 

A tall blond girl had already took a tray with a coffee pot and two cups. The girl didn't look like a professional maid, and was awkwardly handling the cups, when suddenly the latter slipped.

 

Rebecca shouted when the hot coffee hit her chest, and turned the head towards the blond girl to yell some insults, but when their gazes met, she noticed how familiar was that face...

 

The eyes, the blond wavy hair... - "Gayoon?" - She asked, disbelieving.

 

"Ehm, no. My name is Gabrielle".

 

San Josè, 10 Hours Later

 

The red-haired girl walked from the counter towards the toilets, slightly worried.

 

Jihyun opened the door of the bathroom, and glanced inside, looking for the blond girl. When she individuated the girl, she came in, facing the girl whom was leaning against the sink, with a sad eyes.

 

- What happened to you, Gayoonie? I've never seen you running away from a cute girl... - she began.

 

Gayoon didn't say anything, as if she didn't hear her words, and kept to stare at the dirty mirror. When Jihyun approached to the girl, she drew back, holding back tears.

 

- I'm not running away from the girl, Jihyun, you should know that... I thought I would have managed to give a damn about my feelings and I would have just fucked a random girl tonight, but I can't...

 

Gayoon broke off, just to breathe seeing she had talked so fast. - ...Earlier, when I tried to speak english and I failed like an idiot, I felt ashamed... not because of my ridiculousness, but for being moked by the girl I love, the girl whereby I always felt love...

 

Jihyun looked down, trying to bear with the awkward silence. - I guess I can not escape anymore from the thought you might be in love with me... but Gayoon, I'm not the right girl for you...

 

She paused for a couple of seconds - ...If I were with you, I wouldn't make you happy. You've always been the girl that approach another girl and sleeps with her... I am that one that would always cry when she has a crush on a guy... I'm so fucking sexuophobic, how could I be a good girlfriend?

 

- I see... - she hugged tightly the girl, gripped by a need for affection.

 

Gayoon for the first time in the night, smiled, relieved - ...I won't destroy your relationship... I just needed you to know... - she whispered. - ...the hypocrisy would have killed me...

 

She took her hand and pulled her out of the bathroom... - Why don't we enjoy the party, shall we? - ...Approaching to the counter, Gayoon nudged the red-haired girl to draw her attention.

 

She hinted at the corner of the hall... - It seems that miracles do exist... - she grinned.

 

In the corner of the big room, a short girl pushed aside a tuft of dark hair, pulled from the waist the red-haired girl and approached to the face. Finally, Hyuna and Jiyoon could exchange a long kiss on their own lips...


Chapter 25
Today it's the day


Santa Clara, United States of America, 2008

- Today it's the day, Jiyoonie... We'll get a contract or we'll get rejected and I'll have to say goodbye to my dream... I'm sure you can figure out why I want to talk to you... - the girl said.

Jihyun fixed her own combing with a nervous gesture, as if she were in a hurry to receive an answer from the other girl. She leaned against the railing of the little cafè's atrium without looking her into the eyes.

- Yes, I can, Jihyun... - Jiyoon said with emphasis. - We agreed to work as singers just because we need to work, and we are really grateful to you... but I won't hide my sexual orientation if the press ask me...

With the left hand she forced the older girl to turn the head towards herself and look her straight into the eyes. - ...you want me to make sure that Gayoon won't create problems... but she won't. She can't even speak english... but I will create problems...

Jihyun assumed a confused face. - What do you mean?

- I'm talking about my own private life... I want to find somebody to love, and I won't hide just because we need to advertize our group... - she coldly stated with a slight blaming look, as if she were scolding Jihyun just to have thought it.

Jiyoon pushed the cafè's glass door and was about to enter, when Jihyun blocked her. - Wait... let me explain - she said, following her into the place. - I don't mean to ruin your whole private life... Here you can do whatever you want to, but... I need you to not talk about this with publicly...

- I'll think over... Meantime, I've something better to do... - she smirked, earning another puzzled look from the other girl.

Jihyun followed her gaze, from their table to the counter, until she saw the girl Jiyoon was talking about. - Have you seen her? That one with the red handbag... Oh my god, she's so cute...

The other one slewed again to the original position, shaking her head. - Pff... - she snorted - ...she's boyish as hell, her hair are dyed and that bag is a fake... If I had been her mother I'd have aborted...

- You're watching her as you watch another competitor in a race... I'm watching her as you watch the prize... Plus, that girl is obviously gay, and I'm tired of being alone... I might try to approach with her.

Jihyun sighed resignedly and stood up - ...I wish you the best luck with that girl, but I've seen enough... I'm going home to wait Nathan and then I will go with him to the Cube to contractualize... I'll let you know the results tonight.

Jiyoon followed her with the gaze until the girl arrived to the door and opened it, waving her red hair. Unnoticed, somebody sat onto the empty chair near the short girl, straightening her blouse.

- Do you mind if I sit here? - the girl smiled shyly, placing her handbag to the table. - There aren't any other empty seats, here...

Jiyoon gasped, surprised, and she swayed on the chair before she could manage to compose. - Oh, yes... I mean... no, I don't mind. - she looked inside of her eyes, as if she were lost, for couple of seconds until she noticed how she were staring at her...

All features in her body were showy, from the shoes to the short dark hair, but she couldn't stop watching her eyes...

- ...Hey, are you alive? - Jiyoon snapped back to reality, hearing her voice. - ...By the way... nice to meet you! My name is Amber, and you?

- I'm Jiyoon... Nice to meet too - Amber slewed the chair towards Jiyoon, and the latter smiled awkwardly, holding out her hand while she was trying to find something to talk about.

Amber noticed her shyness, and tried to start a conversation. - So... I'd like to ask you... what happened earlier? I noticed how that girl almost ran away. Did you two fight?

Jiyoon cozily leaned her elbows on the table, trying to appear self-confident. - Oh, no... she's just my... co-worker. She gave me some troubles, but we didn't fight at all... she's not that bad but she can be a pain in the ass sometimes...

Peering her eyes, she praised herself for having gained such an effect on Amber, who was staring, intrigued and captivated by her. - Oh... I thought... you two were together.

An indirect question about her sexual orientation... this is the signal she was waiting for... - Definitively not... she likes boys... - she said. Amber deepened her smile, approaching a little more.

- And do you? - she asked.

Jiyoon felt the self-confidence rise into her own chest, as if a Lion were roaring from the inside. - Ehm, no... I don't like boys... - she grinned. Since there was no need to ask the same question to her, she wrote on a little piece of paper her number...

- I'm free tomorrow... so call me maybe?


Chapter 26
Daylight


San Josè, 5 January 2011

As soon the doorbell rang, Hyuna picked up the robe. Behind her, Jiyoon lay there in the nude, silently sleeping, stretched out upon the bed. Standing up, she patted softly her cheeks, before leaving the room.

The girl walked down the stairs, approaching to the door, trying to hastily fix her messy hair. When she arrived near the door, the bell rang again, annoyingly.

- I'm arriving! - she shouted. Standing up in the entrance, a blond girl smiled shyly, as if she hoped to find someone else. Rudely, Hyuna glared at Rebecca, without even asking her to come in.

- What do you want? - she asked with a strained voice, trying to keep herself cool.

- I need to talk with Gayoon... is she there? - she started calmly, concealing her awkwardness and her shame behind a cold voice. Rebecca nervously bit her lips, awaiting for a reply from the girl.

- Who the hell do you think you are, huh? - she said scornfully. - There is a restraining order for you, you know? You've been tailing her for two month but you didn't mind to have it off with her, did you?

Hyuna pulled the door back, trying to slam it in her face, but the blond girl grabbed it. - Let me explain!

Behind her, somebody talked with a weak voice, as if the person had prepared for this previously. - Let her come in... - Gayoon spoke Korean. She patted her hand onto the cold shoulder belonging to Hyuna. - Please, leave us alone for a few minutes... I can handle this - she whispered.

Hyuna nodded and stepped aside, going towards the kitchen. - I'll be in the next room... if she put the moves on you again, just give me a whistle and I will come here to beat the shit out of her. - she murmured as an answer.

Eyeing the american girl, she exited the room... - What do you want? - Gayoon began.

Rebecca sighed deeply, without daring to look into her dark eyes. - Don't worry... I'm not here to talk about us. There is something I think you need to know - she paused. - Gayoon... your sister is here, in America.

The girl suddenly froze, as if she couldn't realize what she just heard. - How do you know I have a sister? huh?

- Don't pretend to be dumbfounded... you denounced me for stalking, and you could figure out I have a dossier with all the data I needed about you. I know how she had been raping you when you was very young... I know how she tried to keep you with herself... I know about how social services took you away from her...

- Stop with that! I don't want to hear my story again... - she shouted.

- I'll give you her address...

San Josè, 15 days earlier

Jihyun stood up and excused herself - Sorry... I have to follow her - she pointed at the bathroom door, in which Gayoon had just come in, a few seconds earlier. - I'm scared she could do something stupid...

Giving a peck on the cheeks to Daniel, she left the two siblings along with Hyuna, Jiyoon and Sohyun, who had just arrived. Kylie took a sip from her sparkling wine glass, toying absentmindedly with her pigtail.

- So, Kylie, what do you do in life? - Sohyun tried to begin a conversation, ignoring Hyuna and Jiyoon who were just giggling, affected by the alcohol that had been flowing pleny into their mouth.

- I am a publisher... and in my free time I write a blog... - she said. - But I don't work in my own, though... I'm at the head of the computing section. I'm always coding and nerding around. It's not that funny...

- Oh really? You code... I do it too! I'm studying computer engineering next year and I've done a lot of experience alone - Sohyun excitedly shouted, swallowing the whole remaining beer in one sip.

The blond giggled. - Let me ask you something, then... are you intersting in a second job? I mean... you'll still need to primarily focus on your singing... - she said.

Hearing that, the young girl chocked on the beer. - Oh my God, Jihyun is right. I shouldn't drink beer... but anyways... are you serious? Would you give me a job!? I'm all ears, what it is?

- I need a web programmer for a new website. I'm trying to create from scratch a thematic portal about homosexuality. I have already contacted journalists and obtained a journalistic license... It's all settled, I only miss some programmers.

Sohyun stared at her in admiration. - I... will... be glad to work with you.

Hold me tighter


San Josè, 5 January

Too many feelings were accumulating inside of Gayoon, a confusion invaded her brain and she was shivering, trying to digest the information. - How do you know I have a sister, huh? - she shouted.

Rebecca bit her lower lip nervously, trying to look into the girl's eyes. She tried to wipe Gayoon's tears, which had started to flow onto the skinny cheeks, but the girl chased away her hand.

Trying to talk in a tone of calm she sighed. - Don't pretend to be dumbfounded, 'cause it will just mess up the things... You denounced me for stalking, and you could figure out  I have a dossier with all the data I needed about you...

Gayoon sobbed covering her own face. - ...I know how she had been raping you when you was very young, Gayoon... - Rebecca reassured her, attempting again to dry her tears.

- She loved me! She defended me whenever my mother would beat me, she comforted me when my father had gone, she was the only one who really cared about me, ok!?

Rebecca hugged tightly Gayoon, who protested, being shushed by her. - I also know this... Listen to me, I know how she tried to keep you with herself... I know about how social services took you away from her...

- Stop with that! I don't want to hear my story again... - she shouted, hiding her face onto the other one's chest. - Hold me tighter, please... - she whispered near Rebecca's ear, who clasped more in the embrace.

After a couple of seconds, Rebecca loosened the hug, grabbing softly her face - I'll give ya her addres, ok?

- Bring me to her now, please... I can't wait anymore - she pleaded.

 

Nodding, she led Gayoon to the car. Her mind came back with memories to the day they met for the first time. She felt awkward, remembering their casual relationship, how she took advantage of Gayoon.

It had seemed to her a normal thing. Now she had a  restrictive order and a complaint on the shoulder. She came back at the day of the trial, in the tribunal and at how she felt awkward, revealing to the court how she had been stalking Jiyoon and Gayoon.

They were both innocent, after all. But she had let herself being obsessed by this case. Now she hadn't got a work.

- I heard your girlfriend has debuted as a singer, with the SNSD... How do you feel being with a star? - Rebecca snapped back to reality, hearing Gayoon's voice. The background noise increased, as they left the main road going through a side street.

- Sooyoung is not my girlfriend anymore... - she calmly explained. - I was supposed to help a girl with a sexual disease, and I ended up having it off with her. Her mother threatened to sue when she found it out...

Gayoon raised her head from her elbow - Sexual disease? What is it? - she asked.

Rebecca could only sigh, figuring out the reaction. - Compulsive masturbation... - she murmured, trying to disguise the awkwardness that followed her words. Gayoon giggled.

- Wow... - she waved her hands wryly. - I thought I were an unlucky girl because I lost my virginity with my sister and I've been popping antidepressant pills for five years, trafficking heroine in my school to not be beaten... - she bitterly said, rubbing her temple.

Rebecca looked at her - Stop it now. I know you've suffered a lot, but this doesn't give ya the right to revile the people who have other diseases... - she blurted, annoyed by Gayoon's derision.

- Oh, I do respect sick people, trust me - she added more mordacity to the speech. - I would be really worried if I had an anorexic girlfriend that can not do without fingering herself... After all, if the solution is having more sex and eating a lot, the problem must be really serious.

Rebecca stopped the car, approaching the side of the road, and turning off the engine. - You always have to be so heartless, Gayoon? One hour ago, you were crying in my arms, you looked like the most fragile person in the world... and now, what happened?

The blond girl sighed deeply, resuming the calm. - I don't understand you anymore... - she whispered. - That's not the girl I used to like... The young singer who speak english in a funny way, always making me smile...

The sandy-haired girl snorted... - The girl you used to like? Are you trying to tell me there was some truth between us!? Huh!? - she shouted, mercilessly reproaching the older one's words.

- Obviously there was some truth between us, Gayoon... Do you want me to show ya? - she blurted.

- Yes, show me!

Gayoon gasped and she dropped the handbag when Rebecca, standing up, kissed her roughly on the lips.


Chapter 28
The green hills


Rout 85, California, United States of America

The famous Green Hills of Mountain View stood up along the Route 85, just outside the Fremont Park. In the fourteen miles of road that separate the urban center of San Josè and Miramonte Avenue, a black car sped on the street, carrying two people inside.

Hyuna sported a new pair of Rayban continuing to mirror to check the appeal and getting some glares from the person in the passenger seat. - Please, focus on the traffic!

The red-haired girl slightly turned the neck towards Sohyun, giggling. - Don't worry! I have everything under control, just relax!

Sohyun chuckled, sighing at her oddities. - You seem too much hyperactive these days, Hyun! - she winked at her close friend, who faked a pout, laughing. - I mean... the sunglasses, the miniskirt... is this due to anyone in particular? - she nudged the other one.

- Maybe... - Hyuna grinned.

- By the way, how did it go, yesterday...? - she nudged her again, even stronger than before - I bet it went fine, you two were so loud that you could hear your shouts from the third floor... - Sohyun laughed, getting a playful slap from the driver.

The latter smirked, hearing the tease from her friend... - Yup! We rolled in the hay from the night 'till the morning... we were doin' it loudly just to piss off Jihyun - she laughed - you know how she gets angry whenever the gayness fills the air...

Sohyun feel silent, thoughtfully staring at the girl - Hyun...? - she asked. - How does shagging a girl feels? - she rolled over to face the driver, who grinned at the question.

- When I'm with Jiyoon... I feel loved... - she explained dreamy eyes. - ...I feel that finally be the one that makes her smile, that makes love with her... Amber has ruined her life, but I will make her smile again...

She paused, trying to catch the breath and tapping nervously the steering wheel... - I'm being selfish, let's get back to your question... - she smiled - why did you ask me, by the way? Do you like some hot chick?

- It's not like that... I like boys, Hyun,  and I'm sure about that, but in my school a girl has a crush on me, and she's so cute. I'm not saying I will go out with her, but I was wondering what would happen if I were with a girl...

Hyuna grinned - Before meeting Jiyoon for the first time, I was sure I liked boys too... and look at me now... - she giggled. - if you change idea, I wish you will have a chat with me, first of all.

Sohyun nodded. While Hyuna was talking, she spotted the building she was going to - We're arrived, Hyun... stop the car.

Route 17, California, United States of America

- Obviously there was some truth between us, Gayoon... Do you want me to show ya? - Rebecca said, slightly blushing though determinated.

- Yes, show me! - the other one replied, defiantly.

Holding the breath, Rebecca kissed the sandy-haired girl passionately, grabbing her hips softly and she slipped the tongue inside of her mouth, begging her to respond to the kiss.

Gayoon dropped the handbag, disbelieving her own eyes. She broke the kiss, violently slapping the american girl on the face... Her tears began to flow, wetting the cheeks and making her sob.

- What the hell were you going to do, huh? It seems like you enjoy watching me cry... - she shouted, trying to turn back to the calm.

Rebecca stood quiet, trying to find the word and being stunned by the violent slap. She rubbed her left cheek, trying to waken the physical pain and the psycological one, to recover from the violent rejection.

She sighed... - I'm sorry, really I am... I shouldn't have done it, it was all my fault... - she said with a broken voice, looking the other way. - I just wanted you realize that it has been some truth between us...

- I don't love you, you should have understood it earlier... - Gayoon sharply replied, leaning the hand onto the cold shoulder of the older girl. - Do you understand that? It was a casual relationship, there's no possible future between us... you were supposed to bring me to Gabrielle.

- This is what I'm going to do, now... I will bring you to you sister and I will forget about you... just one thing, can I ask you a question? - she said. As the other girl nodded, she shyly formulated the question... - Do you love someone? I mean... for real.

Gayoon mused for a couple of seconds. - Jiyoon... it has always been Jiyoon.


Chapter 29
The reasons why


I will bring you to you sister and I will forget you... - Rebecca grabbed the steering wheel, ready to start the engine again, when she turned the head towards the other girl... - Just one thing, can I ask you a question? - she said.

The other girl nodded and she shyly faced her, formulating the question... - Do you love someone? - she said, in a low voice. - I mean... for real. Is there a person who can make your heart beat fast?

The other girl, sleeking her own sandy hair, gave to Rebecca a bitter smile. - Jiyoon... It has always been Jiyoon. But, unfortunately, I will never breakthrough with her...

Starting the engine, Rebecca stared at Gayoon. - Why so? You look meant for each other, in my opinion... - she stated. - But I see, this is none of my business, ain't so?

- At the end of the day, sooner or later I had to tell someone... - she said, leaning on the seat and trying to get herself in a more comfortable position. - The days in which I met her had been really hard for me... I was being banged by my pusher and I had accumulated frustration... - she began.

- She was so small and frightened, and I crushed on her immediately. I protected her from being raped... I protected her from being beaten, and I got beaten myself to save her... but when I finally managed to gain her trust, I did the worst thing I could have done...

Rebecca followed her speech, word by word, trying to piece together the story. - ...I tried to fuck her... I tried to bring to bed a girl that had amost been raped... - she said, leaving the other girl shocked.

Full of remorse, she bit her own fingers, trying to relieve the anger. - ...we became friends, with each passing day, but whenever I tried to approach her with something... about sex... she would always change subject...

She thought back at the first day with Jiyoon, who showed mixed feelings towards her. So shocked to be scared even to touch her, so admired to watch her with adoring gaze.

Images formed into her brain, making her smile. Inside of her memories, she ran with Jiyoon on the tall grass of a meadow. She remembered her dark eyes, her smile, her face.

- We have now made progress... I can hug her, I can touch her face without making her shiver... - she said, still immersed in the memories. In slow motion, those big eyes of Jiyoon shimmered again.

- I realise only now how much I love her.

4Minute's Home, one hour later

In the late morning, Jiyoon woke up in the middle of her bed, stretching her own arm. As soon as she opened the eyes, she noticed the absence of her lover at her side, which make her pout.

She grabbed a pair of shorts, and she slowly came down the stairs, still dazed from the long sleep. Just then, somebody opened the door and made her way along the living room.

The sight of those red hairs made her smile... - Where have you been, honey? - she asked.

Hyuna turned the head towards her, smiling when she recognized the voice of her girlfriend who was calling her, leaning on the handrail of the stairs... - I gave Sohyun a ride, she went to meet Kaylie for her new work...

Jiyoon nodded, coming down to lean a soft kiss on the girl's lips. She carried her lover with a laughter, transposing her to the couch, on which she laid her body, kissing her neck.

She stopped, noticing the troubled gaze of the younger girl. - What is it? - she asked softly.

- I'm a little worried for Gayoon - she pouted. - This morning the bell rang and you know who was? you know who was? It was none other than Rebecca Jackson, who was looking for our Gayoonie - she said, angrily.

Jiyoon was gently sliding her fingers on her brests, when she stopped, hearing the blond girl's name. - And what did she want from Gayoon? - she asked.

- She wanted to talk with her, but then they left... I thought she was leaving once and for all, but when I had come here to talk with Gayoon, I noticed she had gone with her into her car! - she shouted.

The dark-haired girl mused for a few moments. - Gayoon knows what she want to do, I'm sure she's fine... Right now, I'm ought to take care of another girl... - she smirked.

- Aw... and who's that lucky girl who deserves all this attention from you? - she seductively smiled back at her girlfriend, who was already being busy pulling her shirt. Unclipping the bra, she approached at Hyuna's left ear, licking her own lips.

- You will find out...


Chapter 30
It all started


4Minute's House, 2008

- Where are you going, babygirl?

With a pout, the tall girl had called out the other one, who stopped, turning towards her friend. She seemed to be in a rush, the rush you usually have when you're late to do something you like to do.

The short girl wore elegant clothes, her favourite black scarf and a new skirt with which she had not ever been seen before by the other one. - I'm going out with a girl - she winked at her friend.

Smirking, the other one sat on the couch. - Aw! You should have told me earlier, you idiot! - she smiled happily, trying to hug Jiyoon.

Shivering, the dark-haired girl withdrew her arm, with a compulsive gesture which made Gayoon feel sorry. She sighed, thinking of the right words to say, as long as Jiyoon had grabbed her scarf again, approaching to the door.

- I'm really sorry... - she shouted - ...I know it's too soon, but I needed it... Understand me

Her friend stopped again, this time without managing to look the sandy-haired girl directly into the dark eyes. Her thoughts were confused, she couldn't explain herself the act she had done. How comes she don't feel secure with the person who had protected her the most...?

- I'm sorry Gayoon, but I'm not ready for this... I need to go, now... I'm late. - she murmured.

She quickly walked away, grabbing the umbrella and going out in the street, where raindrops had already started falling. She felt guilty for having left in that way Gayoon, but she couldn't bear the sight of those disappointed eyes. She was scare, scared of love and feelings.

Jiyoon thought back at their first encounter, their first dialogue. You looks like one of those girl that always look around and get aroused for nothing, aren't you?

There was something undescribable in the sound of her words. Something incredible, charismatic, reassuring... and something brutish, stark and animalish in the same voice. There wasn't decency in that voice. Though, Jiyoon couldn't help but love it.

- Jiyoon? - a voice called from the near cafè.

The dark-haired girl had come a long way on foot, from the house to the place in which she was going to meet Amber. Once arrived at the right bar, she was called by a loud voice.

Turning towards the place from where the voice had come, she spotted her goal. The girl had short dark hair, dyed with some whitish stripes, and wore a light blue shirt. She had a wide smile on her face.

- Hi... - she smiled back, sitting on the chair beside Amber, who gave her a peck on the cheeks. - So how are you?

The waiter put on the table two cups of coffee, which had already been ordered by Amber. Sipping the coffee, she assumed a worried face. - I'm a little worried for the Thailand conflict... but I don't want to ruin our date. So, enjoy your coffee! - she smiled.

Jiyoon had thought about it just there. She had heard on television about the sparks between the North Korea and the Thailand, and in that moment she realized that probably Amber's parents was there.

She nodded, giving a smile to the other girl. - would you like to walk a bit? - she asked, finishing the coffee.

Receiving an affermative answer, she stood up, holding the hand to the other one and beginning to walk. She was still lost in her thougths, still thinking about the conversation with Gayoon, earlier.

They sat on a low wall, warming their hands into each others'. - You know... it's our third date... - Amber began, slowly, with a shy voice. - ...and I realised that since we've been dating I feel very well... - she smiled. - ...I wanted to say that I like you.

Jiyoon leaned an hand on her hips and approached at her face, fondling the cheeks. She touched the smooth lips with hers, closing the eyes and waiting for her to respond to the kiss.

Breaking the kiss, she slowly stroked again her face, smiling... - I love you...

Three hours later, House

The room was dimly lightened by the moon, which was casting their shadows on the opposite wall. Jiyoon lay in the center of the bed, with Amber's body leaning on hers.

The girl wept silently into the darkness, her tears falling without any noise.

She didn't know, exactly, the reason why she were crying. The only feeling that she could distinguish in the myriad of those which she felt was the fear. Fear of love.

She could hear the words which she heard one years earlier from her mother, who beat her, just for having loved a girl. She had instilled her only this belief: loving is wrong.

Once again, she patted the soft cheeks of her new lover. It was so difficult to exorcise the thought that love could be wrong. It was all so unreal, around her, in that moment. She felt guilty but she felt good.


Chapter 31
Her house


Mountain View, 5 January 2011

Holding the backpack in the hands, Sohyun climbed the short stairs which introduced into the building. As she walked on the white marble, she looked amazed at the edifice.

It looked old, though was equiped with all kinds of communication technologies. An antenna towered on the top of the main establishment, and an electric lock protected the fireproof glass door.

The hyper technological sorrounding on the old building gave a rummy look at the whole landscape, seen from the point of view of the young girl, who kept looking, astonished, at the place.

Hopping on the last steps, she approached to the entrance. Being confused by the absence of the doorbell on the transparent door, she worriedly looked around, to find an alternaive gateway.

As she turned back, she spotted a tall girl on the low stone wall, who was smiling at her.

Kylie wore a large sweatshirt with a rainbow stitched on the front, a pair of pink shorts and her usual headband. Her think blond hair shone in the sun, collected in a tail.

- I guess I should have already told ya the code needed to open the electric lock... I was waiting for you, though... - she said, with her usual dreamy voice. - How are you?

Sohyun smiled at the weird girl, approaching to her. - I'm fine, thank you... - she chuckled, staring at the odd clothing.

Coming in, Kylie led the girl into the building. - We share this building with a travel agency, indeed this is not our headquarter... - she introduced the young girl into the large atrium.

- That one is the typography... - she hinted with the finger to the next room, which was sorrounded by large industrial printers. - ...there we print all of our papery stuff... - she snorted - ...none of my business...

They went upstairs, through a corridor, and they arrived to the last room. - Here we have the real press... this room has got something like 85 computers, and I built all of them myself... - she announced with a proud chuckle.

- ...and this is your location... - she handed a dossier to the girl. - this will tell ya all about what you're supposed do.

A guy with pale hair had come into the room and Kylie took him by his arm, dragging him to Sohyun. - This is Mark... his sister is our editorial coordinator, you will work closely to her, but she's not here now... He will explain you how do we work...

Sohyun shook his hand, smiling. Sitting, she eyed the label which he had pinned to the shirt. Mark Jackson.

Scotts Valley, United States of America

- I realise only now how much I love her... but she's with Hyuna now... and I haven't done anything to avoid it... as you make your bed, you must lie in it, I guess... - she sighed.

Rebecca had passed Lexington Hills a few minutes earlier, going through the Santa Cruz Highway, when they arrived at the small town of Scotts Valley. The landscape featured a wonderful mix of woodland and urban buildings.

They came out of the speedway, going into a side street, which passes through a long series of baseball fields and an elementary school, from which some kids were already coming out.

- You sister works there... - Rebecca said, hinting at the school with the finger.

Gayoon questioningly started at her. - You told me she is the secretary of your employer... you haven't ever told me anything about her being a teacher... - she pointed out.

- Indeed she's not a teacher... - she rumbled in a low voice. - She takes the coffee to the teachers... and I suspect that she also do it wrongly... - she thought back at her misadventure with that woman.

The sandy-haired girl slightly got pissed for the surly tone of the other one. - What do you mean? - she asked.

- Forget about it... - she said. Rebecca steered her car around the corner, continuing in the tree-lined street, until she arrived to the destination, a small house hidden behind a spruce.

As the american girl stopped the engine, Gayoon started looking in the house's direction. A slight panic accompanied the thought of seeing again her sister, the person with whom she had grown up. 

A piece of her wanted to burst into the house and slap her with rage for having abused her, when she was only a thirteen years old kid. Another piece of her wanted to hug her with love, to thank her for having defended her and cared about her when they didn't have anything, not even the food.

She got off the car, slowly, catching the breath. Then, with convinction, she went into the house.


Chapter 32
We lost


4Minute's house, San Josè

Jihyun held the folder, putting on the glasses to see better the paper which had been handed to her. - I don't get what you mean, Nate... what do you exactly mean with 'we lost'?

- What do I mean? I mean that we have just been kicked out by the Cube... we no longer have a contract with them - she shouted - they are tired of your quirks, and I can't blame them...

Those words hit violently her mind, when they were pronounced by her Manager. She sat on the leather chair, eyeing the document again, while not wanting to read it.

She would have to predict it, but it was not fair. She had been working for this for so many years, she had shed blood to gain a shred of reputation... and what had she had in return? Nothing.

- How comes to you as a surprise? - Nathan leaned an hand on her shoulder. - We haven't sold more than twenty thousand of cds... Nobody has called us in television... during the first radio interview Jiyoon has sparked a scandal...

Jihyun had stopped being that person who hides her tears... with the thumb, Nathan dried her wet cheek, outlining a smile on the face. - It's not fair, Nate... we've been practising hard, I have been seeing a psycologist, we were all growing up... things were going well...

Her manager sighed. - They need a solid team... Jiyoon still has got some problem touching Gayoon, you feel insecure on stage...people would ask questions, you perfectly know this...

- I'm tired of waiting for the feedback, Nate... our plan was to set up a recording studio and make independent music, and we have ended up selling all to the Cube... - she yelled. - I can't take this anymore...

Nathan stood up, nervously tapping the fingers to the table. - Don't blame me, Namji, blame your co-workers... - she calmly stated. - If Gayoon and Jiyoon weren't here, we would be enjoying a successful tour right now...

- Don't talk in that way about them... I don't give a fuck about your perfect plan to make money, they are my friends, and I'm tired of fighting with them instead of singing and writing songs, which is what I should be doing. Right now... - she emphasized the last two words.

- ...it's quite useless to write songs right now, Namji... we haven't got no longer any contract! - the manager shouted, turning towards the door.

- Well, goodbye, Nate... we quit! Enjoy your unemployment... - Jihyun loudly yelled at him.

Mountain View, United States of America

Mark Jackson. Sohyun had put two and two together, and she knew whose brother was him. Rebecca Jackson must have found a new work since she had been dismissed.

Her younger brother looked nice, he would smile whenever somebody spoke to him, and he knew how to do his job. He hadn't inherited the same geni of her sister, and he hadn't got that haste which characterized the rudeness of the latter. He was a simple man.

Sohyun's hand leaned against the keyboard, ready to write some lines which had come into her mind, though she didn't manage to do it. She couldn't focus on the work right there, and she stopped for a few seconds.

In the next seat, her co-worker was typing quickly, being concentrated on the program. Noticing her gaze, he stopped as well to rest the fingers, smiling once again towards the short girl.

- Need a rest? - he asked, standing up from the chair. - Why don't we go out for a walk...? we could drink a beer in the near bar.

Walking, Sohyun looked at him better, to catch some more details. He had pale chestnut hair, and the fair skin which used to connote her sister. He wall tall, at least taller than her.

It was pleasant to be with him... Sohyun and Mark stepped on the cobblestones, betaking themselves towards the bar which was located on the other size of the street.

They came into the bar in which there where a cozy atmosphere. He ordered a beer at the counter... - So... Sohyun... I heard that you're a singer. What brings you here, working in a publishing company?

Sohyun sipped the beer. - Well... we have recorded a cd, but it didn't sell a lot... if the project fails, I will need a work... - she shyly stated.

Intersted, Mark tried to continue the conversation. - How have you known Kylie... I mean... I suppose the work has been given to you by her, she usually don't take people around the building without a logical reason...

- To be really honest... I've known her because... - she shyly stuttered, being awkward for the reason she was going to give - I've known her because her brother is my friend's boyfriend... - she said. - please, don't think that I'm recommended... I seriously needed this work.

Surprisingly, he just chuckled a bit... - Is that funny? - she pouted.

- I'm not laughing because of you, don't worry... It's funny because Kylie tends to shout from the rooftops all her project whose subject is homosexuality... - he explained.

- ...Probably, she had fun embrassing her brother in front of his girlfriend...

- oh... - Sohyun giggled. - I see...


Chapter 33
You've grown


 

Gayoon didn't understand the feelings which she was feeling. On the one hand, the anger whose effects she had been suffering made her want to yell at her, shout, slap her, but on the other hand... her sister was the most precious person she had in the whole world.

 

She got off the car, approaching to the little house. Speeding up at a brisk pace, followed by the american girl she walked the alleyway, coming in front of the doorbell.

 

The sandy-haired girl caught the breath, visibly shivering. - You'd better ring the bell... there isn't anything to be afraid of... - Rebecca smiled, slightly pushing the younger girl towards the door.

 

- I'm scared... - she whispered.

 

The blond one hugged gently the other one, reassuring her. - Everything is gonna be alright... if you didn't have any fears you would be a robot - she smiled - you've been waiting too much for this moment...

 

Taking heart, she rang the bell.

 

They heard some noises come from the inside, and some footsteps near to the door. Slowly, the white door swung open, leaving a glimpse of the living room and the kitchen behind.

 

Heo Gabrielle was a skinny woman of about twenty-five years old, her somatic traits were mixed between a european and a korean person. She had the hair tied up in a ponytail, of the charateristic color of the sand.

 

The two sister resembled each other. The same dark eyes, the same hair, the same slim body and the same way to walk.

 

Gabrielle was shocked by the sight of her sister. She couldn't speak, the tears slowly wetting the face, as she tried to simmer down. - Gayoonie? - she weakly asked the younger sister, who threw herself into the woman's arms.

 

They embraced tightly each other, wiping silently. - Oh my god, Gayoon, is that you? - she cried.

 

Separating themselves, Gabrielle noticed the person behind her. - You? - she asked Rebecca, confused. The blond american girl stepped forward, coming into the atrium.

 

- Me - she calmly replied to the woman. - I hope you won't mind having me in your house... I have already forgiven you for having stained my favourite skirt with that coffee - she stated. - I am clumsy as well - completed with a wide smile.

 

Gabrielle turned to the younger sister, who had been watching them, oblivious of their precedings. - Come in, Gayoonie, I have so many things to tell you, and I guess you have things to tell me as well...

 

The two guests came into the room, the younger one staring amazed at the house, eager to talk with her sister. They sat on the comfortable couch, as the owner led them into the living room.

 

- I am sorry for being such a horrible sister, Gayoonie... I have always loved you and I regret having done such... things... - she stuttered, eyeing Rebecca, who was distractedly toying with the handbag.

 

Gayoon sighed heavily, catching the breath. - She knows all about us, Gabri... - she began -  don't worry, we can trust her. Nodding, Gabrielle nervously adjusted her position on the chair.

 

- If I could change the past, I wouldn't repeat the error which I have done so far... I wouldn't rape you. - She cried. - You were my only reason for living, you were my kid. When dad has gone, and mom was always drunk... you became my kid, my little Gayoonie... and I confused my feelings...

 

Gayoon hugged her sister. - I am stronger now, Gabri... and I have already forgiven you. I want to know what has happened later... when you enlisted my in the military group, what happened to you? I lost track of you...

 

- I am really sorry for not having written you even one letter, but I was ashamed... - she lowered her weak voice.

 

- What has happened? - the younger girl said with concern.

 

Taking her eyes off, she immersed herself into the memories, slightly showing signs of pain. - I left the Korea a few months later... having no job, I travelled to Europe and I found a work as a stripper in France... I was hoping to find my real father, but I failed.

 

Rebecca kept staring at them, annoyed by the deep conversation in korean. Sometimes, she would prefer speaking korean with Gayoon, seeing she can't stand the younger girl's way of talking, using korean words with the english grammar. Though, she was having problems understanding the speech.

 

- ...seven months ago, I left France to the States, and I found a work as a secretary... now, though, I'm not going to stay here for much longer.

 

Her younger sister gazed the woman, confused by the statement which she had said. - What do you mean, Gabri? Where are you going to stay? - she asked.

 

- It was a difficult choice... but I want to come back to korea.

Broken


San Josè, United States of America

Well, goodbye, Nate... we quit! Enjoy your unemployment...

Those words jangled again into his ears, as he walked towards the car, which was parked just outside the garden. He couldn't help, but feel angry, betrayed by the person whom he thought to know.

Nathan jumped into the car and he was going to start the engine, when the phone rang loudly into his pocket. Slipping the latter from the jacket, he pressed the reply button.

- Nathan Price... - he answered. Nam Jihyun's manager, he would have said just a day earlier. - Who's calling? - he said, instead.

A few moments of silence and the interlocutor answered. - I'm Alicia Perez, Mr. Price... Cube Entertainment U.S... I wonder if you have some time to talk... - the calm voice said.

- Oh, yes, I have time - Nathan nervously replied to the woman. - What do the Cube need, Mrs. Perez? I have already informed Jihyun about contract break up, and I told I would take back our stuff from the recording studio tomorrow.

The voice chuckled. - It's all ok, Mr. Price, we already know... I would like to talk about Hyuna, instead... - Hyuna? What could they want from her.

- ...We have analyzed our statistics, and we have realized that the few fans who the group has, are focused on this girl. We want to offer another chance to Hyuna, and you're still her manager, formally.

Surprised, the manager straightened on the seat, listening with more attention. - The Cube wants me to offer a new contract for Hyuna? What about the other members?

- Mr. Price, come on! You're smarter than that. Should I send you a copy of the selling charts? There is a long line, which is very near to the zero, unluckily it is too near to the zero. I'm giving Hyuna a possibility...

He had to think fast. He couldn't just accept and come into the house again with such a offer, could he? - I will tell Hyuna... - he weakly whispered with a sigh. - Will I be still the manager?

- Of course you will be, Mr. Price... We're very grateful to you for your work - she chuckled.

Ending the call, Nathan looked at the house. Jihyun emerged from the house, probably ought to go for some shopping, heading to the nearest market. Maybe he will be lucky, his car which is still parked won't be noticed by her.

As the girl disappeared behind the corner, he sighed in relief. He got off the car, directed to the house and he rang the bell.

He knew that Hyuna and Jiyoon were in a relationship, and he would rather die than being the third wheel between two people who are probably doing only God knows what, but he forced himself to wait there.

Enjoy your unemployment... He couldn't stand that thought, he had to work... he would deal with the guilt later. 

She stood patiently in the porch, waiting for the people inside to open the door. Finally, he could hear some noises and a few moments later, the door opened, revealing behind the latter Hyuna.

Luckily, she don't seem busy. - Jihyun has gone to the market - she said. - I heard you two fight, earlier... what happened?

Coming in, he saw Jiyoon on the couch, who was lazily lying there, watching the television. She would hear the conversation, but he wanted the talk to be private. - I need to talk with you, Hyuna, not with Jihyun... could we talk, alone?

- No, we can't - she said, slightly annoyed - Whatever are you going to tell me, it can be heard by Jiyoon and even if it were, I would tell her later... so, go on with your speech.

He sighed heavily. - The Cube has broken up the group, this morning... - he calmly said the red-haired girl, who was incredulously staring at him with a mix of anger and anxiety. - ...but they want you for a solo album.

Jiyoon raised the hand, shocked by the news as well, and she laid a hand on the girlfriend's shoulder. The latter, though, was still a little bit astonished. - They want me? For a solo album? - she asked, unbelieving.

- As I said, they want you give you another possibility... unluckily for the group, the sales are too low to have a renewal. - he continued. - I got to go, now... I don't want you to tell Jihyun about this, or else she will kill me.

Jiyoon snorted - Frankly, Nate... you deserve to be killed by Jihyun... but since I want to safeguard my girl's interests, I won't tell her anything. - the short-haired girl said. - Count you lucky, my dear, count you lucky...

Sorry


Mountain View, United States of America

"What do you mean, Gabri? Where are you going to stay?" - Gayoon asked, surprised by the unexpected question.

Her sister sighed deeply, patting her cheeks - "It was a difficult choice... but I want to come back to korea" - she said, anxiously waiting for her sister's reply, who seemed to be caught off guard.

Biting her lips, she stood up walking back and forth as she needed to analyze the situation. - "I don't want to lose you again, Gabri... if you go to korea, I will come with you" - she said.

Rebecca worriedly interposed in the conversation. - "There's a war there, Gayoon... you can't go, it's dangerous!".

"If Gayoonie wants to come, I can't stop her... she's not a kid" - The girl's sister calmly said. - "We're not going to go in a battleground, our house is quite far from the territory of the war" - she added.

She was being overprotective. Gayoon is neither her girlfriend nor her sister, and she was not supposed to worry about her. - "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to intrude"

Gabrielle nervously interlaced the hand's finger, slightly annoyed by the blond american girl. - "Could I ask a question?" - she said, staring at them.

"What is your role, here?" - Gayoon's sister asked - "How are you related to my sister? I know Gayoonie, we share the DNA and she wouldn't tell a friend about such personal things... are you her employer or something like that?"

The athmosphere dropped, her sister feeling awkward and the blond girl even a little scared. Rebecca tried to take the floor, but Gayoon stopped her.- "I'd better handle this myself, ok?" - she added, giving her a glare.

"We have slept together, sis... I mean... we're not together but she has told me that you here in the States. If I hadn't been told, I wouldn't have found you, so please..." - she said it all in one breath.

"Ok, ok, I've understood" - her sister waved to shut her mouth. - "I'm not in a position to criticize, so I will not... you've seriously grown so much Gayoonie...".

8 Years earlier, Kaesong (North Korea)

In the small garden a very young skinny girl played absent-mindedly. She didn't have any toys with her and she had to settle for a little doll and a rusty piece of metal as a dollhouse.

She was a little bit old to play with the dolls, but she couldn't help but isolate herself from the rest of the world. 

Somewhere in the house, her mother was fighting with her sister, and she did everything possible to cover the ears, but the shouts could be clearly heard anyway.

She had been playing for a while when their yells ceased and she heard somebody behind her, patting her head. Her sister reassured her, fixing the kid's sandy hair.

"Mom has gone" - she whispered. - "She will not beat you the next time, trust your sister".

Taking her sister's hand, she brought her into the house. When they arrived in the bathroom she slipped the little girl's dirty shirt and she could see a very large bruise on the shoulder.

The naked baby shivered, weeping silently. - "Did she hurt you?" - Gayoon slightly nodded, without uttering any word. - "Don't cry, I'm always here for you" - she said as she dried her cheeks.

Gabrielle picked her sister up and they came out of the bathroom silently, heading to the bedroom. Finally, the girl spoke.

"Gabri?" - she whispered to draw the attention of her sister. As the sister turned, she asked with a weak voice - "Why did mom beat me and why is she always so angry?".

"Mom is sick, Gayoonie, because she drinks a lot..." - she stopped, as she didn't manage to explain to the younger sister what alcoholism is.

"Now let's go to sleep" - she said with a slight smile - "shall we?". Gayoon nodded again.

Bending on the girl the older sister slipped off the pants and the panties which were soaked. She hated it, but she was aroused. Forthwith she withdrew the hands from the naked body of her sister.

She bit her lips, worried because that was wrong, very wrong. The sandy-haired girl on the bed was her sister, for god's sake, and she was only thirteen.

But lust had taken possession of her, and, suddenly, she lost the control of her own body. - "What are you doing, Gabri!?" - her sister said.

"Don't worry... it will be pleasant and I will take it slow. Do you trust your sister?". It was all confused, and out of focus in her mind. She hated it all, she hated to do such things to her sister, she hated herself. But she couldn't help.

Gayoon had been motionless during the whole intercourse, and her young innocent eyes were staring at her older sister with guilt and anger.

I'm sorry, Gayoon, I'm sorry and I hate myself for doing this.


Chapter 36
Inspiration


Mountain View, United States of America

The sun set behind the hills and the temperature slowly dropped, the light fading in the whole landscape which could be clearly seen from the typography.

Sohyun looked out the window, tired by the long day spent in the workplace, and she stood still to admire the beauty of the californian sunset. Behind her, somebody leaned the hand against her shoulder, drawing her attention again.

"Watching the dusk?" - the person behind her asked with a weak voice, slightly coughing. - "This looks so romantic" - the girl's dreamy voice stated, sitting near the short-haired one.

Sohyun turned towards her to greet her employer, smiling, but she was suripried by the sight of her. Kylie didn't wear her usual weird clothes, but rather a simple coat with a scarf. She was clearly shivering.

"Kaylie, are you ok, you look sick..." - she asked with concern the older girl, who signed to don't worry, without any reply.

The american girl looked weary, as if she had not eaten for a few days. - "I'm fine, Sohyun... I might have caught a cold, but I will get over it, you shouldn't worry about that" - She drew a smile.

Nodding, Sohyun stood up and grabbed the bag, ready to leave. - "I guess now it's time for me to go, Kaylie..." - She wearily stated, stepping towards the door. - "Are you sure to be ok? Do you need anything?"

The blond girl smiled at her naivety. - "I swear that I'm fine, Sohyun... you've worked hard today, so you deserve some sleep. Go home and rest" - She said - "I will just be arranging some papers and then I will go to bed".

Sohyun was going to exit the door when she called her. - "Sohyun?" - to draw the attention of the girl, who turned towards her... - "I will not work as a programmer forever and you're doing a great work. Will you be ready to take my place?"

Shocked, the girl nervously nodded. - "Of... course, of course I am ready... why do you ask me this, Kaylie?" - she awkwardly smiled, still astonished by the unexpected statement.

"Because you are a great programmer, of course" - she smiled. As the younger girl had waved goodbye and had exited the door, she sat on the ergonomic chair behind her desk.

"You're really a great one, Sohyunie" - she whispered wistfully to herself.

Route 82, Sunnyvale 

Sohyun passed through Sunnyvale with her scooter when it was very late. The midnight neared when she entered the urban area of San Josè, with the wind on the face, announcing rain.

Some droplets of rain had already started falling from the sky during the way home. She couldn't help but think back at her employer's words.

She was used to Kylie's cryptic statements and weird acts, but that evening she had sounded so serious about it. Was she talking seriously or had the american girl drunk more than usual?

Her behaviour scared her a bit, but she pushed away the superfluous thoughts to enjoy the fresh air of the evening.

She felt alone, somehow. Jiyoon had Hyuna and Jihyun had Daniel. She had seen them all date, break up, fight, make peace and she had been told about their stories, but she had not had any boyfriend.

Nobody could understand her, every word spend by her friend instilled her the desire to have one, but she was happy alone, after all. How comes that was hard to understand?

Lost in the multitude of thoughts, she arrived home and she got off the scooter. A single light could be seen on in from the outside, and some random shadows were stirring, inside.

Turning the lock with the key, she came into the house, trying to make less noises as possible. Somebody was still awake since she heard some voices come from the living room.

"Where have you been today, we were waiting for you. We have things to talk about..." - Jihyun's calm voice said. Sohyun could spot her sitting on the couch, talking with Gayoon. Jiyoon sat near the oldest, her stare blank.

"I've been with Rebecca..." - The sandy-haired admitted with a cold stare - "...but let me finish. I've met my sister, Gabrielle! She's in the states and I've finally found her!"

Sister. Gabrielle. Sohyun recorded into her mind these two details since she didn't know that Gayoon had a sister. How comes she didn't know? What does she mean with 'found'...? She was lost?

"Ehi, ehi, slow down!" - Jiyoon shouted - "your sister is in the States and you have seen her today?" - she asked with a surprised voice, unbelieving.

"You must be shocked..." - The red-haired one said, with a delicate tone. - "I mean... she has abused you. How can you be happy to meet her again?"

Abuse. Gayoon had been abused by her sister. Sohyun watched in horror the scene, not believing they could hide so much secrets. What else could they hide?

"I don't want to talk about this" - Gayoon stated - "She's going to go back to Korea in a few days... and I will go with her" 


Chapter 37
It won't help


One week later, Home

It was early in the morning, when the sandy-haired girl had finished packing the bags.

Gayoon went down the stairs, carrying her heavy luggage on the shoulders and she looked weary, sweating for the effort. She absently eyed the wristwatch to check the time, when somebody came into the living room.

"Think twice about that, Gayoon" - Jiyoon, behind her, worriedly warned her. She wore only a camisole and the underwear and she was slightly shivering for the cold, although showing an expression of self-confidence on the face.

The other one didn't reply her, and she kept carrying the bag towards the door, pissed off.

"Talk to me, Gayoon, please... I do care about you, and I don't want to let you go that easily so, please, talk to me..." - She softly pleaded with gain the girl's attention.

Gayoon turned towards her, the sorrow on her face. - "After all, this is what you wanted, is not it so?" - She said with a broken voice. - "I'm not meant to be here, Jiyoon, I should have understood a lot of time earlier..."

"Why do you say so, this is not true" - the short-haired one tried to console her friend.

A single tear fell on the cheek, wiping away in the soft sandy hair. - "You have Hyuna and Jihyun has Daniel. I'm sick and tired of waking up alone in a cold bed wondering what have I done wrong to deserve such a life of shit..."

After the yell, she tried to calm herself, hiding her face into the hair. - "I know that you don't deserve this, Gayoon. But going in Korea, with your sister, the one who has abused and abandoned you... it won't help!"

"Do you think I haven't considered the problem...? This is the only way to forgive. Forgiving Gabrielle. Forgiving myself. Forgive you, for having treated me as a lurid pervert who you don't even condescend to touch..."

"It's not like that, Gayoon... we've been best friends, we've loved each other... all that I wanted to do is preserve this from being ruined by a peddling sexual relationship. I was scared by you, don't you understand?"

Once again, Gayoon looked away to hide her tears falling onto her facial features. - "I used to understand, Jiyoon. All that I understand now, is that I need some time alone to forget about this seven years... Goodbye, Jiyoon" - She said, grabbing the luggage and running away.

 

She ran away, as fast as possible. She had slammed the door on her best friend's face, and all she could think about was her. She thought back at her memories of them running together in a lawn, trampling the grass of the grove where they used to have training sessions.

Each time she would try to grab the girl's hand, the short-haired girl would withdraw the hand and scold her for being pervert. It hurted.

Babygirl... do you believe in love? - Her own voice resounded into her brain. She could understand it only at that moment, but that question was sincere. It wasn't another way to gain the girl's attention...

She didn't realize the time passing, when she had got on the bus, neither did she when she had got off. With the bag loaded on the back, she finally arrived at her destination: her sister's house.

"I've been waiting impatiently for you..." - Her sister smiled, as she had put the younger girl's bag into her own car.

Her younger sister jumped quickly into the car, without even uttering a word to the other one, and Grabrielle got on the blue car as well, eyeing the person who sat on the passenger seat.

"Has something happened? I see you're sad" - She softly asked Gayoon. - "Listen to me... we've not seen each other for years, and if I were you I wouldn't trust myself as well. But starting from now, you can trust me..."

Gayoon grimaced, still mistrusting the person near her - "...a girl..." - She reluctantly whispered. Invited by her sister to continue, she took a breath and let it out the words.

"I have been rejected so many times that I couldn't count them... I gave up, I tried to get a life. But whenever I tried to bring to bed a girl I would fail. Nobody wants me and now that I'm going back home... she tells me that I'm doing an error and that she cares about me..."

"I'm really sorry, Gayoon... the life is a whore whose lusts we are born to satisfy and I've given up on love a lot of years ago. But you still have got a chance, why don't you take it?"

"If I came back now, entered that door and said her I love you... what do you that it would happen?" - the younger sandy-haired girl said, with regrets painted in the voice... - "do you seriously think she wouldn't reject me anymore...?"


Chapter 38
Injuries


Mountain View, United States of America

Rebecca parked the car a few hundreds of meters back the old building, as she liked to walk through the little garden to reach the top of the hill. She wasn't in a hurry, being early, so she airily immersed in the memories.

She used to go there  when she was younger, earlier than her first work, and she had a lot of memories coming back in the brain, some happy and some sad.

She had kissed her first girl around there, sitting on a bench of those, and she remember that a boy had tried to kiss her right there, leaning against one of those green trees. Horrible situation...

There was something sad with her, these days. She remembered  about her youth and she couldn't help but become sad because she wouldn't be spontaneous anymore, since she've been living in San Josè.

Her work as a reporter had deleted her will to live. The last person whom she had slept with was part of her job, another of her pitiful attemps to prove that the music industry is corrupt.

Results, a crush for a mentally unstable girl with a box of analgesics and a complaint for stalking. She wondered why her girlfriends had always to be psychically unstable.

Overcoming the exit of the park, she stepped on the white marble as usual and she reached the old building's atrium. Being six o'clock in the morning, she didn't expect anybody to be there.

She slowly pushed aside the door of the editing room and came into the place, turning the lights on. She spotted someone leaning against the table, quietly sitting on the ergonomic chair, who was silently sleeping.

Surpised, she approached to the young girl, brushing aside the light blanked off her. She wore only her underclothes, except for her indigo camisole and the coloured socks, painted with some cartoon character.

"Kylie?" - she whispered, suprised - "Have you spent another night working, with the flu and the fever...?" - the american journalist scolded softly her.

Kylie issued a groan, complaining. As she put an hand on the girl's forehead, she could sense it was hot because of the fever. - "You are burning, Key-key... I'll bring you in the hospital, your flu is no joke apparently..."

She carried her with a strenght which she was not supposed to have, and brought her out of the building. A step, another step, and one more step foreword towards the exit, the staircase seemed to be endless.

The embrassement was rising as she exited the front door. Kylie was half-naked under the heavy blanked which was laid on her body and now she was carrying her passing through the park.

Luckily, not so much people were gathered there when she crossed the garden.

"Re...be...ha" - She heard another slight groan from the younger girl, who was cautiously moving the heard, trying to face the girl whose arms were wrapping her softly. - Wh-wh-where a-are we go-going?" - she babbled, shivering heavily.

"Shush..." - She said with a soft whisper. - "You have the influence, don't overstrain".

She kept holding her like a little kid. Like a mother... She thought. Hidden behind her unconscious mind, she missed touching somebody like that. Take care of a sick person gives you vibrations of freedom. And authority.

Moving her thoughts away she drove with her car until the hospital. She wrapped her bare skin with her own jacket, to preserve heat in that body. They walked in the atrium where a nurse welcomed her.

"Oh my god, what has happened? Has she fainted?" - The nurse said, pointing with the finger another room where to put Kaylie's unconscious body. Following Rebecca, she asked about the situation the older girl. - "Is this your daughter, Mrs...?"

"Miss Jackson" - She replied with an annoyed voice. The constitution of this state prohibits gay marriages, she added mentally... - "And how old do you think I am? She is not my daughter, obviously!"

"How are you two related, so?" - The nurse, offended, unkindly replied Rebecca.

"She's my employer".

"Is this a joke? I thought this girl had like... fourteen years old..." - she said. Incompetent people. Luckily, a man in his fifties dressed as a department head doctor interrupted them, entering the door behind the nurse.

"Marisol, is there any problem?" - she calmly scolded her subordinate, sitting on a chair near Kylie, who was still unconsciously lying there in the middle of the bed.

As the nurse called Marisol shook her head, and came out of the room, he approached to the young girl and gave her a sudden look, with a worried gaze. - I'm sorry. Marisol is young and she gets nervous when she makes mistakes... how old is this girl?"

"She is twenty... I'm sorry for her quirky clothing... she's a little bit eccentric"

"There isn't anything to be sorry, I'm used to worse things" - He smiled back, grabbing a stethoscope.


Chapter 39
Death and splits


San Josè, House

"Do you seriously want to accept that contract?" - Jiyoon opened the door and entered the room slowly, approaching to the bed. She sat there, awaiting for a not coming reply from the girl sitting on the chair.

Hyuna sighed heavily, eloquently giving her the message that she was not willing to talk about that. - "I see, you don't want to talk about this, but you should tell me whether you decide to accept a work or not... I'm your girlfriend..." - She pleaded.

The short-haired girl started undressing, pushing aside her t-shirt to make her way to the other one through the bed. - "Don't try to seduce me, it won't work... I'm too in anxiety..." - The red-haired girl replied.

Patting slowly her cheeks, Jiyoon gained a feeble smile from her partner, smiling in her turn. - "I know you are... let's talk about it, it shall help you too chase away those bad thoughts, ok?"

She earned a chuckle from Hyuna, who slowly took off her shoes to easily get under the blankets. - "Fine... I decided to accept it" - she revealed, hugging the older girl.

"I will support you in every way, but... don't you think Jihyun will get angry with you? With both of us, telling the truth" - She said, giving her girlfriend a worried gaze.

"Jihyun doesn't have the guts to face me and tell me that I am a bitch..." - She bluntly replied, with a smirk on her face - "It has always been like that, and we have known each other for years..."

Hearing that, she let a bitter giggle slip, thinking back at the several times in which Jiyoon would have liked to punch Jihyun's face for being irritable.

"Anyway..." - Hyuna said, putting the emphasis on the ellipsis - "She will be angry with you, and I don't want you to get annoyed by her... the best choice is telling her that and let me intimate her not to fly off her hand..."

"Are you sure to handle her without any problem?"

Facing her, she softly leaned in for a kiss. - "We're talking about a girl who practise how to make blowjobs with the toothbrush... it can't be so hard to leverage her guilt..."

"What the...? are you serious?" - She gaped, letting out a chuckle. "Hyun, you're too cruel with her... she is still our friend and the person who taught you everything about music... don't be ungrateful!" - She added, without being able to keep from laughing.

Hyuna approched her face, giving her another kiss. - "The anxiety has gone, now I feel relieved..." - She whispered with a smile - "What if we start from the beginning...?"

Replying with a smirk, Jiyoon slipped a hand under her shirt. - "Gladly..."

Incheon International airport, South Korea

Gayoon uplifted her heavy backpack with a great difficulty, her forehead sweating as the girl followed her older sister out of the airport's main building. The sun was about to set and a slight breeze ruffled her sandy hair.

The younger of the two stared with the mouth open at the crowd of people who would enter and exit the front door. The busy traffic slightly scared her, used to the american transport system, definitively less messed.

A man with the headphones who was talking of business, clearly late, even bumped her, making her drop the luggage. - "Motherfucker, watch where the fuck are you going!" - Gabrielle shouted, picking up the bag and helping her sister stand up.

Meanwhile, the man had already run away, disappearing in the crowd. - "Are you ok?" - The older one asked, holding her sister's hand.

"Yes, I am..." - She replied. - "It's just that... here there are so many people, there's too much traffic, too much noise..." - she said. As she was handed the luggage they walked again on the sidewalk.

As soon as they arrived at a taxi stop, they carried their bags on one of them, ordering the driver to lead them in Paju.

- "Paju?" - Gayoon questioningly stared at her older sister, a slightly worried gaze painted on her face. - "I thought we were going home" - She added in a low voice, not wanting the driver to hear them.

"Our house is gone, Gayoon..." - She calmly explained - "I haven't ever managed to be sure of that, but if my calculation are not wrong, our house has been replaced by the Kaesong Industrial Complex..."

Still disconcerted, Gayoon waited for their trip to finish patiently, even falling asleep in her sister's arms. The sun finally disappeared over the horizon, in the cold korean sky.

Some stars had already appeared in the firmament, when Gabrielle heard her own phone vibrate. She opened the oncoming messages and she saw a voice record sent by an unknown number.

She opened it with the lowest volume, to prevent her sister from waking up and she approached the device. A worried masculine voice panted heavily, some noises were in the background. Gunshots.

"Gabrielle... I'm dad..."

"...I don't have time to explain everything with a voice message, but you must come here in Kaesong. Pass the border in Yeoncheon, if you go through the woods nobody will see you..."

The voice made a pause, as if the man had stopped to catch his breath. But the record was not finished - "Gabri... mom has died. Please come back soon wherever you are..."


Chapter 40
Ace up the sleeve


Mountain View, El Camino Hospital

Rebecca lay there on a chair, with the head leaning on the bed, on the top of the soft blankets. She had fallen asleep a few hours earlier, when the door swung open to let the doctor enter the room.

She was still too confused to focus on the situation, when she heard those footsteps approach to the door. Somebody behind her gently shook her body, to make sure whether she was awake or not .

"Ms. Jackson" - The doctor called, in a low voice. - "Ms. Jackson, Kaylie is awake and she would like to talk with you".

Rebecca opened a single eye, and she saw the doctor smile her, busy tidying up some papers to put in the small locker near Kylie's bed. - "Key-key?" - she asked with an unsteady voice.

"It's me who is supposed to sleep, not you silly..." - Kylie chuckled, putting a water bottle on the near table. - "Did you sleep well?" - she smiled.

With a slight giggle, Rebecca stoop up, trying to fix her messy hair. - "Yes, I did... what about you, how do you feel?" - She asked with concern, taking place again on the little chair.

"I am fine, don't worry!" - She reassured. The younger girl turned towards the old man, who was still fixing some paperworks. - "Excuse me, doctor... could you give us some time alone? I'd like to talk with my, uhm... employee about private stuff..." - She said.

"Sure, I will wait out of the room..." - He smiled, amazed by the weird behaviour of the young girl. He collected the stack of documents and exited the door, closing it behind himself.

Ensuring to be alone, Kylie sighed heavily before starting her talk. - "Becky, I want you to take over the reins of my department these days..." - she opened - "The doctor has given me some morphine earlier, and I doubt that I really feel good. I don't want to have more crisis, no?"

"But I don't have enough preparation to be the head of a technology department... I am a journalist..." - She worriedly said, questioning about the younger girl's intentions.

The latter, grabbed her hand, watching the older in the eyes. "You don't need to do anything... just focus on the blog project and make it as gay as possible, ok? I have already given Sohyun hints that if something happened to be, she would replace me in the technical coordination..."

"You have what? You already knew that you would be sick?" - Rebecca asked.

"This is not important right know... just do your work along with Sohyun and everything will be fine" - Hearing those words, Rebecca sighed as she realized she would have worked side by side with Sohyun. Sohyun hates her.

"I know what bothers you... Sohyun will make your life a living hell and she will remind you about your story with Gayoon every single second. But you have an ace up your sleeve"

Rebecca stared with a dazed look at her, giving a questioning look. - "What do you mean with ace up my sleeve?"

"Sohyun likes your brother"

Kaesong, North Korea

The two sandy-haired girls had been walking for hours when they finally saw the lights of the cemetery. After a long period of silence, the younger one found the courage to speak.

"How can you be sure that mom is buried here...?" - She said, clutching her coat to preserve heat from being blown away by the cold wind.

Some dark clouds announced a storm, and some droplets of rain had already started wetting their clothes when they finally arrived at the rusty gate, which was broken. They could pass it without any problem.

"We can't be sure of that... to be honest, we can't even be sure that she has been buried..." - She said with a strange broken voice. - "...but I want to find my mother, whatever it costs"

"Gabri, I think I know this place..." - Gayoon whispered, shivering for the wind which was tightening its blowing. She walked forword for a few meters, under the watchful eye of her sister, and she turned the corner behind one of the small building which probably had housed the direction of the cemetery.

Behind there lay a large meadow, the tall grass spreading everywhere. - "I have already been here... Gabri..." - She called out. - "I think we're not far from my old school..."

Her sister followed her, as the younger girl kept stepping forword among the tombs of the cemetery. "I used to come here with... with a friend when I was in the army..."

She thought back at the numerous time in which they would go there. She remembered herself running in the meadow, Jiyoon's soft hands clasped between hers and couldn't help, but remember herself being rejected...

She dismissed the thought, staring again at the place. - "But those tombs..." - She said, pointing with the finger a group of tombstones. - "They were put here later..."

Gayoon gently pushed the dust away from those stones, trying to read the names. Shocked, she realized that their names were all students who were in the army with her. Classmates, sometimes...

She had cleaned up almost half of them, when she froze in front of a white tombstone.

"Jeung Hye-jin..." - She whispered.

The sunset


Home, San Josè, United States of America

The sunset was near when the two girls in the bed finished making love between the soft covers and some shade of orange were already painting the formerly blue sky.

With a chuckle, Hyuna pushed aside the blankets of the bed to stand up, collecting from the ground her bra and her panties. As she noticed that they were ripped in a point, she threw them aside, tearing a giggle from her girlfriend.

"You're so violent, honey..."

Jiyoon in reply threw her a pillow, laughing in her turn. - "I couldn't keep my head above water, Hyun..." - She said, standing up and hugging tightly the red-haired girl from her back. - "Your body were screaming me to eat you up..."

Teased by the sedective whisper, the younger one pushed back on the bed the older girl, blocking her wrists with the hand. - "Do you want me to take revenge?" - she replied.

She had just leaned a kiss on the older's neck when the doorbell rang loudly, forcing her to let off. - "Is it possible that whenever I'm having some fun somebody would have always to ring the bell?", she cursed, grabbing some clothes to make her way towards the stairs.

Followed by Jiyoon, she descended the stairs and swung the door open. Leaning against the wall, a tall man with brown bushy hair exhibited a smile, holding a folder. - "Did I interrupt anything?" - He said.

"Yeah..." - Hyuna replied with a blunt exclamation. - "Yes, Nate, you did but I guess that I must let you in anyway, so... what brings you here?" - She coldly asked, interspersing it with subtle irony.

"Sure, keep laughing like a idiot. Honey, someday you'll thank me for letting you wiggle your lesbian ass in a few videos..." - He bluntly scolded her. - "But let's get into the serious stuff, shall we?"

Receiving a nod from her, she took a paper out of the folder. - "I just need your signature, Hyunah... I don't bite, so let's make a ceasefire, ok?" - He said - " If you sign this paper you will be a contractualized singer under the Cube Entertainment..."

Behind them, holding each other's hand, Jihyun and Daniel entered the room. Hearing the girl's voice, Nathan cursed loudly, turning behind to face the girl. But she stopped, realising what she had just heard.

"She will be what...?"

Mountain View, United States of America

Sohyun was tapping the fingers on the keyboard, leaning the head on the shoulder. It had not been a nice day and she was just waiting the end of her shift to go home and rest.

The office was empty besides from her and neither Kylie nor Rebecca had shown up during the day. She stood up, intentioned to go to the terrace, when a hand blocked her from behind.

"Going out to get some air?" - A soft voice asked the younger girl who smiled.

Holding her hand, Mark walked with her to the terrace, slightly chuckling because of the girl's awkwardness. - "It might sound weird and... inappropriate, because I shouldn't know this..."

He started with a cautious voice. - "But I know about your breach of contract with your label and... now more than ever you need a job, so..." - He said, with a short break to eye her reactions.

"I seriously shouldn't tell you this, but Kylie wants to give you a promotion..." - He said.

Sohyun was kind of astonished and unbelieving, keeping her gaze fixed on the guy's brown eyes. - "You must be kidding me, aren't you... I mean. It can't be possible..."

"You know..." - He giggled - "I'm kinda envious of you..."

His compliments, his kindness, his way to flirt. Sohyun had never felt like that before. Finally, she could understand what love felt like and, even more important, she felt her loneliness fade away.

Sohyun had a wide smile on her face, taken by euphoria. - "Why would a handsome guy be envious of me?" - She blurted, laughing. If she thought about that phrase, it would sound stupid to her. But she was kind of sure that it was the right thing to say right there.

"Well..." - He began - "First of all, I will be an employee of a cute girl... She might not notice me among all her team of programmers..." - he joked, still holding the other one's hand.

"And... what if the boss had already noticed you...?" - She replied, approaching her body with his. - "and... what if our relationship would get a... in a manner of speaking... a promotion?"

Their face nearing each other, everything seemed to become calmer, even fuzzier. As the sun set, under the first lights of the moon, they finally could exchange a long, sweet and warm kiss.


Chapter 42
Worthless dream


San Josè, United States of America

The ticking of the rain pounded on the machine frame, increasingly fast-paced and loud.

Jihyun checked the watch, realising just at the moment how late she was and she pushed the accelerator pedal, making her car gain speed.

That afternoon had been very cold, the rain overwhelmingly falling down on the street, but Jihyun didn't care. She drove faster and faster, she just needed to talk with somebody, let it all out...

Her work was gone, her dreams broken in thousands of pieces. Her best friend and manager had betrayed her, giving Hyuna a possibility without even telling her.

Everything seemed to slowly break down, as if the universe were too tired to keep working and God, somewhere in the ethereal sky, was packing her luggage to fade away.

They call it depression, but it is not worth the definition. Without a work, she didn't know what to do, what to say, where to go. Jihyun would never ask her mother to get her back home. Her dignity prevents her from doing it.

She parked the car near the tall building, removing the key from the dashboard and opening the door, covering with the hood of her sweatshirt. Once ready, she jumped out of the car, protecting with her hands from the windows.

Still loudly falling down, the rain wetted her clothes and made her cough heavily, untill she could reach the buidling's front door and take refuge under the shelter.

As she rang the bell, a few seconds later the automatic door opened, letting her in. She climbed the stairs quickly, skipping the steps to go faster. Arrived at the third floor, she found the apartment's door already open.

She headed in. Her psycologist was waiting there, smiling calmly at her and he patted her shoulder, leading the girl inside, towards the near room. - "I'm listening... why did you want to talk with me so urgently?" - He asked with a soft voice, taking place on the leather chair behind the desk.

Jihyun breathed. Slowly. Calmly. Taking self-control.

"I got fired..." - Not a single tear escaped when she pronounced that sentence. It looked more like an admission, as if she was telling him that she failed, that she's not good as this, that her dream were out of reach.

He put on the glasses. - "You got fired..." - He slowly repeated. - "I guess there must be a logical reason, what do you think it could be? Why did your label dismiss a wonderful singer like you?"

She looked up in suprise. - "I... I haven't ever said that I am a good singer, though... To be honest I am not. Not good a writing lyrics, not a good rapper, not a good anything... they dismissed me because I suck... we suck, our first cd has been a fail..."

"First of all..." - He said, scribbling as usual some stuff on his pocketbook. - "...I didn't ask you whether you are a good singer or not. You have problems with your self-esteem, and it inhibits your ability to judge yourself properly. In my secular and objective opinion, you are a good singer... do you trust me?".

Receiving a nod, he continued. - "You told me that the CD didn't sell a lot of copies, didn't you? Then it's the listeners' fault if they kicked you... but let's move on the real problem. There must be a reason why you're so upset, is it not so?"

She nodded again, containing the tears.

"Yes, there is a reason..." - She began, wiping the tears with a handkerchief. - "My manager has offered Hyuna a new contract without telling me... I know, I deserve it, but I feel betrayed..."

"I suspected it but, again, you didn't point out the problem..." - He said, giving her a pat on the back - "...you don't really care whether your manager gives her a new contract or not... the problem is that your student has been given a new contract..."

He held her hand, drawing her attention to be able to watch her directly in the eyes. - "Your brain tells you that even your younger friend is better than you, but it is not true... why do you think Hyuna is given a contract?"

"She's a good singer, she's hot, she's..."

He interrupted her with a smile. - "And if you were given a contract, why do you think it would be for?" - The answer arose spontaneously inside of her mine. Because I am a wonderful singer. Not very hot, though...

"Exactly, Jihyun... this is not a matter of skills. Hyuna is just more beautiful than you... don't take my words wrong, you're gorgeous, but if I were a young fan of a Hip Hop group, I would choose Hyuna... she attracts the people..."

Jihyun frowned. - "I deluded myself that I could match against her sex appeal... it was just a worthless dream, so?"

"Dreaming is never worthless... think about your boyfriend. When he looks at you and Hyuna, he will surely notice how Hyuna is more self-confident with her own body, but does it mean that he loves her? Whom does he love?"

"He loves me..."


Chapter 43
Loud and clear


Yangju countryside, South Korea

The wind howled loudly, at the foot of the hill. On the side of the deserted road, a body lay there, without a move, inert like a grain of sand carried by the gusts but still alive, as its heart beat faster and faster.

In the middle of the deathly silence, the air was filled with the screech of an ambulance siren. As the ambulance arrived near the body, a man got off the police car, approaching to the motionless body and the brown-haired policeman who was waiting there.

Helping the doctors to carry the body into the ambulance, the man called on the other policeman.

"Full report, officer..." - He said with his tired voice, calling for his attention.

"Woman. Korean. Probably about twenty years old..." - The brown-haired one replied - "Someone has called the emergency number, saying that he found her body lying there, two hours ago..."

The superior approached, carefully observing the young girl. - "She bleeds..." - He said, pointing his finger her. - "Has she wounds caused by sharp weapons?" - He added, turning the body.

The officer shook his head. - "I don't think so, lieutenant... do you see that tear on the clothing? The trajectory of blood spatters make me think she has been raped..."

"But the coroner's first report says that there are no traces either of sperm or latex... what if the killer wanted to damage her genitalia without necessarily raping her, maybe out of jelousy...?"

"I can exclude it... if she had been stabbed, she would have bled far more and she probably wouldn't have survived. She has not passed out because of the hemorrhage, though..."

"What do you suggest, so?"

The officer sighed heavily, running the hands through his hair. - "I don't know, boss... if she has not been stabbed, neither have had sexual intercourses... then we must wait for her to wake up".

"What if she was raped without any condom and without the raper finishing the work? This would explain why are there not any traces of latex nor of sperm..." - The superior suggested.

The ambulance bounced on the road, passing on a hole. The landscape flowed away, seen from the inside of the rescue vehicle, during her way to the hospital.

"May be... at least I don't exclude it. Do we know something outstanding about her personal life"

The man shook his head, upset. - "The only information we know about her is her name..." - He said, giving his superior a threadbare ID card.

"Heo Gayoon..."

Mountain View, El Camino Hospital, 20:00

As every wintry day, the moon rose in the sky in the early evening, painting the sky with its pale light and opposing the orange shades of the setting sun.

Along with the sunset, the night announced an uncommon cold and the breeze was intensifying, forcing the american blondie to hold her coat more tightly during her walk towards the hospital.

Rebecca stepped swiftly on the white marble of the entree, ignoring the uniformed girl of the acceptance with a babbled excuse. She quickened her pace, trying not to make loud noises with her heeled shoes meanwhile her feet ran through the hospital ward.

Finally, she reached the desired floor, slightly panting for the rush. The spotted the nurse who she was looking for, heading towards her. - "Marisol, wait... It's me, Rebecca!" - She shouted.

The girl with hispanic features recognized her, stopping her walk to allow the blondie to reach her. She looked very tired, and her eye circles revealed her weariness - "What are you doing, here?" - She asked with a faint voice.

"I heard Kylie got moved in another section,can I see her?" - Rebecca pleaded, her eyes meeting the younger girl's gaze.

The nurse shook the head, revealing her sorrow. - "I can't allow you... I won't lie to you, Rebecca, Kylie is currently in quarantine" - She said.

Rebecca shook her her, trying to digest those information and suppressing the urge to scream, and let the frustration out. The nurse spoke again, with a more careful voice - "Rebecca, do you love her?"

That was a strange question. Did she love Kylie? The boundaries between the yes and the no were very labile, but the older girl knew she wouldn't touch her even if she could. She loved her more like a little sister. Or even like a child.

"Why do you ask me?" - She said.

Marisol breathed, leaning a hand on her shoulder. - "I will tell you loud and clear, Rebecca. If you had sex with her, tell me now" - The nurse said, her voice even more faint and unsecure.

"Obviously I didn't! What do you even..." - Suddenly, she understood. The continued fevers, the constant illness... and now that question. Kylie had immunodeficency. The voice trembling, she looked at Marisol directly in the eyes. - "She has AIDS, doesn't she?"

"Yes, Rebecca... she does."


Chapter 44
Strength


Home

Hyuna clasped her hands together with Jiyoon, interlacing the finger. On her face she had a graceful smile, mixed with those childish features which revealed that the girl had something to say.

The short-haired girl smiled in her turn, holding the hand. - "Come on, you're hiding something from me... what is it?" - She gently asked, a slight pout flickering on her face.

As the red-haired girl sat on the couch, ready to reveal the thing which she was hiding, Jiyoon grabbed a bottle of red wine and uncorked it, making use of a corkscrew and handed her girlfriend a glass.

"Hold on tight..." - Hyuna warned her, grabbing the glass of wine which she was handed by her. - "My new contract includes being part of a musical! I will go on tour!"

Jiyoon chocked on the wine, sputtering droplets of drink all over the table. - "No way!" - She shouted, asking the other girl for a confirmation. - "Shit! This is wonderful Hyun, you will be in a musical!" - She screamed euphorically, surprising her girlfriend with a rough kiss.

Laughing, Hyuna broke away from the kiss, grabbing a napkin to clean the messy stains of wine on the table. - "I know it's fantastic... but it would be better if you were singing with me, like the old days..."

"I don't know... singing has not ever been my real dream" - She stated. - "but you... you definitively deserve it. Let's drink a toast to honour you career, then..." - She concluded, filling the two glasses again.

Hyuna raised the glass and so did Jiyoon. - "To the career!" - She laughed.

"Jiyoon..." - She began with an insecure voice. - "What will you do, now?" - She asked - "If singing is not your dream what will you do?"

Giving her a flick on the chin, she thoughtfully stared at her taking a few seconds. - "Right now... I just want to be a good girlfriend to you and accompany you on your tour..."

She smiled, placing her glass on the table. - "When the tour will be finished... why don't we have a kid and get settled once for all?" - She proposed.

Hyuna yanked her neckband, pulling her girlfriend to herself to give her another racy kiss. - "Oh my god, are you serious?" - She squealed. - "Whoah... this is so surrealistic. I don't know what to say..."

"I will simply accept an I love you..."

North Korea, 30 Hours Earlier

The rain was falling hard.

Gayoon was still too shocked to utter a word when they arrived at the old inn. Seeing all those old graves of people who she knew was dreadful, to say the least, and she couldn't help but think how the war removes people from the earth in such a destructive manner.

She followed her sister inside of the dilapidated building, dragging the heavy luggage behind her. The lodge had dirty windows and the floor was lousy enough to make them shudder.

A middle-aged man behind the counter noticed the two women entering the place, and he seemed loath to welcome them. - "If you need to rent a room for the night, you will pay in advance..." - He coldly said - "I don't trust those whore who you see around nowdays..."

Watching him awry, Gabrielle pulled out from her bag some cash money and handed the hotel manager the right amount. The man rudely grabbed the money and gave her a key, pointing out with the finger the direction for the room.

"Ehi..." - Gabrielled whispered Gayoon, noticing her mistrustful stare towards the hotel manager. - "I know you're shocked since we have visited the cemetery... but we mustn't get pissed by that stupid man, ok?"

The younger girl nodded, stepping forward towards the room. Once arrived, they put down the luggage, wiping the sweat from their forehead.

Safely in the silence of the bedroom, Gayoon threw herself on the bed, exhausted. - "Do you remember when I used to tuck you into bed?" - Her sister asked, sitting next to her.

Gayoon closed the eyes, trying to banish her memories of her sister's abuse. The bittersweet taste of her lips invade her mouth came to her mind, making her shiver.

"I know it was wrong what I did to you, Gayoon..." - She said, gently patting her legs. - "...but I can't help but still find the sight of your body so intoxicating and perfect... I wish you were mine..."

Her hands carefully palpated the bare legs of the girl, who remained motionless, unable to react. Her sister kissed her lips, denuding her helpless body with slow gestures.

Gayoon wanted to oppose those avances, push away Gabrielle and shout her pain, but she couldn't find the strenght. She felt those fingers outrage her nakedness, the blood flow in the middle of her legs. This time it wasn't virginal blood, but real blood from a real wound. It was a real rape.

Ignoring the pain she finally pushed off her sister's body, crying loudly. - "You said you wouldn't do it again..." - She wept, while Gabrielle recomposed. - "You lied to my, you're just a filthy whore!" - She screamed.

A violent slap hit her face, causing her to fall. Images faded away, her body slowly fainting.

The last thing she could see was her sister carrying her body, out of the room, under the violent roar of the rain.


Chapter 45
Choice


House, 34 Hours later

Jiyoon woke up in the middle of the bed, still a little bit sleepy. She lay there in other person's arms, her head on her bare breasts, relishing the warmth spreading over her face, softly, gently.

The girl watched towards the lighted watch to read the time, stretching her arms to relax her muscles and she stood up, exiting the door without a noise, ascertaining that her girlfriend wouldn't be awaken by the creaking of the wood.

Walking, she thought back at her conversation with Hyuna, the day earlier.

When the tour will be finished... we don't we have a kid and get settled once for all? The short-haired girl was filled with euphoria yet couldn't just believe what had said. It didn't seem real but far and unreachable just like a blurred dream. Was she even ready for this...?

Jiyoon walked into the kitchen, opening the refrigeretor and grabbed a milk bottle, sipping its content with automatic gesture. The girl absentmindedly sat on the couch, wondering what to do. She was too sleepy to do anything yet too wide-awake to sleep.

It was already the midmorning, even if the house was almost empty thus leaving the place in a complete silence.

Hard to admit, but she missed the old times, when Jihyun would wake them up to every morning to work on their music, instead of spending the night at her boyfriend's place... and Gayoon would insult her with idleness, drowning the head in the pillow again.

Jiyoon smiled. She missed also that strong Gayoon, her hero, who used to protect her when they were just collegial students. That old Gayoon was gone forever, destroyed by drugs, compromises and heartaches.

This is the only way to forgive. Forgiving Gabrielle. Forgiving myself. Forgive you, for having treated me as a lurid pervert who you don't even condescend to touch...

Remembering their fight the day when Gayoon had left the country, she sighed. Those words hurt a lot... if she hadn't rejected Gayoon, would they be happier or even more sad than they were now...?

The short-haired girl pushed away those complex thoughts, putting some coffee beans into the coffee machine and pressing a button to turn it on. She was about to start eating her breakfast, when the phone rang.

Annoyed, she grabbed the device and answered the call.

A manly voice began, slightly unsecure. - "Hello? Am I talking with Ms. Jeon? It's Yangju police department" - Hearing those words, Jiyoon instantly froze. What could a South Korean police department want from her?

"Uhm, yes, it's me... what... what's the matter, officer?" - She stuttered a reply, sitting on the couch since a sudden dizziness hit her. She had a bad feeling about this.

"Ms. Jeon, we are very sorry to disturb you in the United States, but we have just hospitalized a girl and her phone had only your number memorized on. It was memorized as 'babygirl'... could you tell us what is your relationship with Ms. Heo Ga Yoon?"

Her foreboding was true. Gayoon had been hospitalized and she was thousands of miles far from her. - "We... we are just friends..." - She babbled. She mentally cursed herself for emphasizing that 'just'. She knew it would sound strange to the officer.

Luckily, the man ignored the hint, and let her continue the sentence. - "...what happened to her? Is she fine?" - She asked.

"So far, she have been showing sign of improvement, she will recover completely... Yet, she has still not waken" - The police officer added. - "The doctors will take care of her don't worry Ms. Jeon..."

"I want to see her" - The short-haired girl firmly stated, her voice trembling. - "I will jump on the first flight to Incheon and I will be there as soon as possible..." - She said.

Muttering some apologizes, Jiyoon ended the call, putting down the phone and turning towards the stairs, intentioned to pack some clothes for the way. Standing there, leaning against the wall, there was Hyuna.

Her girlfriend wore non other than a dressing gown, and her face was upset. - "I heard it all, Jiyoon... are you really leaving?" - the girl asked, following the girl up the stairs - "My tour is starting in three days... I thought you were coming with me!"

Jiyoon didn't reply, she just hugged tightly her girlfriend to make her calm. - "It's just for a few days, Hyun... Gayoon had an accident and I don't even know what is it..." - She said, grabbing some clothes from the wardrobe. - "I want to see her..."

"But she doesn't deserve it...!" - Hyuna blurted, her eyes filled with anger and her arms crossed, expressing her disappoint. - "She left us and treated you very badly... why do you even want to see her?"

Jiyoon stopped, her fists clenched - "Hyun, she's my best friend and she will always deserves my attention if something happens to her... It doesn't matter whether we fought or not, I'm going to Incheon today..."

The red-haired girl snorted scornfully, her anger increasingly rising - "You know... my tour starts in three days and I thought you were coming with me! But if your prefer that bitch, feel free to go there..."

A slap reached Hyuna's face, making her girlfriend drop a tear. "I... I am sorry, Hyun..." - She apoligized. - "I will be back, I promise it! But I can't just ignore her, she has been hospitalized in a coma, for god's sake!" - She shouted.

"Go... go and see her" - Hyuna bitterly replied. - "If you are not back in three days, I will know what your choice is..."

Security box


Hampton Inn, Mountain View

A ray of light lit the room, passing by the open window and tickled with its warmth the lying body.

Sohyun woke up, sensing the gentle touch of a soft hand, and she cautiously opened her eye to get used to the intense light. The girl's naked body was wrapped between white blankets.

She could spot the other person, who was illuminated by the sunrays. Mark's pale brownish hair shone, enlightened by the morning sun. His face, his features and his smile brought back to her mind memories of the previous night and the feelings which she experienced, making her smile in her turn.

"Good morning, dude..." - She joked, standing up from the bed to get dressed. The red-haired girl put on her panties and her jeans, picking up from the floor a wrinkled t-shirt.

"It seems that we enjoyed the night..." - She exclaimed, noticing two empty bottles of sparkling wine on the bedside. - "Shit, I was so drunk..." - She laughed, rubbing her temples.

He chuckled, pulling her for a deep kiss. - "You have the most high alcohol tolerance I have ever seen in my life, Sohyunie" - The man said in a whisper. - "...and this is a requirement to be my ideal girl".

"So am I your ideal girl?" - Sohyun asked, still holding his hand.

"You are perfect for me and I love you, but I didn't think you could like me... you know, when I first met you I thought you were gay..." - He said, making the girl slap his arm, a playful pout on her face.

"Is this for my short hair?" - She giggled.

Mark shook his head. - "Ehi, it's not like that! I don't have this kind of prejudices... I am a man of the twenty-first century." - He said - "I thought it because you were hired for the Blog project. Kylie usually hires only lesbians like..."

"...your sister." - She completed. - "I still find hard to think that you two are relatives... I won't lie to you, I don't like her..."

He nodded - "I know, she may be a pain in the ass... sometimes I'd like to slap her as well, but she is a great journalist" - He sighed heavily, still eyeing his girlfriend. - "I haven't inherited her character, though... I am not like her just because I'm her brother".

"Don't worry, dude. I don't have this kind of prejudices... I am a woman of the twenty-first century."

Mountain View, United States of America

Rebecca absent-mindedly toyed with her sweatshirt laces, sitting on the empty chair. Her office was exceedingly silent as all the employees had already come back their home, except for the blond girl.

It was very late, but she didn't mind staying there, even for the whole night. What purpose was going home for? She had suffered too much to avoid nightmare, and sleeping wouldn't help her regain strenght...

The girl heard some footsteps some from the hallway, and after a few seconds the door swung open, letting her see the newcomer. A man stepped in, and Rebecca could see his face. His hazel eyes immediately reminded her a person...

"Hi..." - He began - "...so you must be Rebecca Jackson" - Daniel Walker offered her his hand, but the journalist, mistrustful, hesitated. She wondered why did the man look like he was looking for her.

"Yes... in flesh and blood" - She coldly replied.

Daniel sighed, sitting near her. - "Kylie told me that you don't usually talk too much... but she also told me to trust you, and I will do so. Do you trust me?" - He asked, looking up to meet her gaze.

"Go ahead..." - She replied with a broken voice - "What did you want to talk about?"

The brown-haired man took a small piece of paper out of his pocket. - "Kylie had this hidden into her pants..." - Behind showed the paper, Rebecca could read its content. Everybody has an ace up the sleeve - it said.

Rebecca was unbelieving. She stared at the message, remembering her last conversation with Kylie. - "What does it mean?" - Daniel asked.

"I don't know..." - This didn't make any sense, Kylie had talked her about Sohyun liking her brother. What does it have to do with his brother? - "I wish I had the right reply but I really don't have idea about its meaning..."

She was about to leave, when she had an illumination. What if Kylie actually didn't mean that Sohyun liking her brother was the fact. What if she meant that she had an ace up her sleeve and Sohyun liked her brother?

The ace wasn't to be found nowhere else that her own abilities. - "Kylie wrote this for me..." - She firmly said. - "She wanted me to found something, but I know neither what is this nor where is it..."

"Could it be hidden in this room?" - He asked - "To my knowledge, this is the only room which has a strongbox like that" - He pointed out an old and unused safe-deposit box.

Rebecca whiffed, shaking her head - "Every single device used by Kylie has a 32 characters long alphanumeric password... she wouldn't hide something in a box which can be opened by pressing 5 numbers. That one has neved been used, as far as I know..."

"But... my sister wanted us to find it..." - He whispered - "So maybe she decided to hide it where we could find it without knowing a complex password..." - He said, earning Rebecca's nod. - "So why don't we try with her birth date?"

"Once again, you show your lack of preparation towards Kylie's riddles... She wanted somebody to find it and this person could be either me or you" - She replied. - "Why don't your try with your birth date..."

He typed 19.2.79 on the keypad, but the box signaled error. Rebecca approached and, closing her eyes, she tried her own birth date. 3.12.79.

The door of the box swung open.

Heart to Heart


San Francisco International Airport, 1 p.m.

Korean Air's flight 6114 directed to Seattle is leaving in 10 minutes. All the passengers are invited to go to the Gate 17. Thank you.

 

When the metallic voice spoke, Jiyoon stretched the ears to check whether it was her flight or not. Realizing that it wasn't, she sat again on the cold chair in the waiting room, placing the luggage on the floor.

She watched the passengers directed to Seattle stand up and go towards the gate. Taking a water bottle from the bag, the girl tried to relax just for a moment, distancing the anxiety that gripped her mind.

In twenty-five minutes, she would have jumped on a place directed to Seoul, missing the opportunity to attend her girlfriend's first performance and thus losing the younger girl's heart.

The weariness was so great that she couldn't think clearly, and her frustretion grew stronger and more intrusive. It wasn't right at all...

Gayoon had been her bestfriend for years and she deserved Jiyoon's attention now. Her girlfriend had acted selfishly and the short-haired girl kept repeating in her mind that it was the right decision... but... what if she was right?

This is the only way to forgive. Forgiving Gabrielle. Forgiving myself. Forgive you, for having treated me as a lurid pervert who you don't even condescend to touch...

Those word still broke her heart whenever she would remember them. But Gayoon didn't meant it, did she? They were both scared by their ambiguous relationship...

 

Once again, the metallic voice came loudly from the speakers. Korean Air's flight 24 directed to Seoul is leaving in 20 minutes. All the passengers are invited to go to the Gate 19. Thank you.

 

"It's your flight..." - A voice spoke behind her.

Jiyoon, surprised, looked up to indentify the person, and she could see Jihyun sitting in the chair in front of her. - ...I was wondering whether you would seriously take this flight..." - She began. - "...and I also questioned myself whether I wanted you to go or not..."

The short-haired girl questioningly stared at her. - "What do you mean?"

Jihyun shrugged. - "I just meant it... I am not sure whether I want you to go or not..." - She pointed. - "When I left house, two hourse ago, I wanted to kill you because you left Hyuna..."

She stopped, as if looking up words. - "...but now I understand that you two are not meant to be together. Maybe you did the right move when you broke up with her..."

The older girl looked for the younger's gaze, who was refusing to look her in the eyes. - "I'm not going to break up with Hyuna, if it's this that you're asking... I'm just leaving for a few days."

Jiyoon stood up, grabbing the luggage and stepping towards the gate, but Jihyun caught her - "Wait..." - She pleaded. - "I know Hyuna... and she is not angry because you won't attend her performance..."

"So what is she angry for?" - The short-haired girl shouted.

Distant, the sound of an airplane taking off filled the silence. - "She is angry with herself, full of frustration and jealousy because she realized that you don't love her... She is leaving you free..."

Approaching to the younger girl, Jihyun dried her watery eyes with the finger.

 

Korean Air's flight 24 directed to Seoul is leaving in 10 minutes. All the passengers are invited to go to the Gate 19. Thank you.

 

Jihyun gave a worried look at the clock. - "Since you have been dating Hyuna, I thought that you two were perfect, but I was wrong... you know who are you meant for..."

The short-haired girl lowered the gaze. Jiyoon agreed it all, but she didn't want to admit it. Hyuna was not the right girl for her and their relationship was based almost exclusively on sex.

They didn't trust each other, they didn't talk so much. There wasn't feeling.

"I know what are crying about..." - Jihyun said, lifting her chin to meet her gaze. - "You are feeling unsecure, because you rejected the person you love... there's nothing to be ashamed for. You and Gayoon were not ready for that..."

Once again, Gayoon's question came to her mind. Babygirl, do you believe in love?

The truth was that love is not just a feeling. Love is an eternal war happening inside of your head, that contrasts your body and your heart. Real love goes beyond the stereotypical love and touches the deepest thought and feelings.

It's not easy to accept it, but at some point in your life, you need to choose between heart and body. You can't have both, it goes against the natural order of things.

The short-haired girl knew what she would choose. No more body to heart, like her relationship with Amber. No more body to body, just like the story with Hyuna.

Just Heart to Heart...

Jiyoon stared at the girl with an ashamed look... - "But I still think she's more beautiful..."

"Obviously she is more beautiful, Jiyoonie... does this mean that you love her?"


Chapter 48
Last wish


Yangju, Hospital

Gayoon cautiously tried to open her eyes, covering her face with the hand to prevent the intense light from dazzling her. Once her eyes had gotten used to the daylight, she started examining the sorrounding environment.

She lay in a hospital bed, her body wrapped in a white nightgown and her left arm was run through by a drip filled with water. A nurse gave the back to her, probably unaware that she was awake.

The girl's sight was very blurred and she couldn't think clear, but she managed to emit an indistinct sound, to catch the nurse's attention. The woman turned towards her, with visible apprehension.

"Doctor, she is awake!" - She called out loud. Waiting for the doctor to arrive, the young woman approached to Gayoon's bed, slowly removing the drip from her arm. She took a little bit of cotton wool to plug the little blood spill.

The doctor entered the door, together with a police officer who had a folder held inside of his hands. - "Hi Gayoon... can we have a talk...? I'll just ask you a few questions" - He carefully said, motioning the nurse and the doctor to leave them alone. 

The man sat on a chair, near the bed, examining the girl's behaviour. - "Do you know why are you here?"

The events of the day before came back to the sandy-haired girl's mind and the violent images of her sister who hit her filled her brain. She emitted a whimper, before finding the strength to reply. - "I am here... because I have been raped..." - The girl whispered with a broken voice.

Nodding, continued. - "I know, this is difficult for you, but I am sure that you want to find the bastard who raped you, right?" - He asked.

Receving an affirmative nod, he asked the next question... - "Did you see your aggressor or do you remember anything that could help us to find him?"

Gayoon closed her eyes, trying not to burst out in tears. - "Yes..." - She said - "Her name is Gabrielle Heo".

Mountain View, United States of America

Rebecca had slowly typed her birth date on the keypad, almost closing her eyes. Three, one, two, seven, nine... once tapped the finger on the nine, she heard a little click, and the security box's door swung open.

She eyed Daniel, who was attentively trying to see what was there in the box. Rebecca slipped a hand in and saw that the box was empty except for a DVD.

Immediately, the girl took the disc out and examined it, trying to guess where did it came from. - "I think we should see what is there inside of this disc. I doubt that this was left here haphazardly..."

She removed it from the custody, and inserted the dics on her laptop. After a few seconds, a dialog box opened and showed that the disc had just a video file called 'OpenMe.avi'.

After a double click, the video opened. It was a registration of the security cameras, and it was dated '12.21.2010'... Rebecca's first job interview with Kylie.

The video had a low resolution, but she could clearly see Kylie enter in her office along with her co-worker, Cynthia. After a few moments of uncertainty, the older woman spoke.

 

"I don't like that girl, Kylie..." - Cynthia said. Probably Kylie had just finished talking with Rebecca, so the woman was talking about her. - "She looks like that kind of person who pisses her pants easily... so weak and vapid... why do you even want here to be part of the project?"

Rebecca was kind of angry for being insulted, even if it were just a registration, but she didn't say anything.

"There are several things that I didn't tell you, Cynthia..." - Kylie said - "let me explain you the story from the beginning, ok?"

Kylie took out of the closet a medical record. - "A little time ago, an emergent singer caught my attention... her name was Jiyoon and she had been the first singer with enough guts to shout from the rooftops her homosexuality..."

She paused for a moment. - "I got very interested, and I noticed that journalist named Rebecca Jackson was following her everywhere... While the poor journalist received a complaint for stalking, I was already looking for more details..."

"Details?"

Kylie nodded - "Yes, details... I found out a lot of things about her friend Gayoon. She was raped by her sister, and I started investigating. Do you even figure what I could get if I had written a book about this puzzle? Maybe I would have won a Pulitzer..."

"Unluckily, I had a little accident... when I was trying to go through this story, I slept with Gabrielle, and I contracted AIDS..."

Cynthia was astonished - "You did what!?"

"You heard me..." - Kylie whispered - "I don't know how much time I have to live... I could die tomorrow or in two years and I need Rebecca to finish my work. I will leave her a DVD with all the encrypted proofs... We all want the person who killed me and raped a poor girl go to jail, no?"

"Obviously... but why don't we just kick her out!? Why did you hire her as your secretary?"

"I just have to die, Cynthia... Rebecca will know what to do..."


Chapter 49
The last sunset


Yangju Hospital, South Korea

The sunset was approaching and the red glow of the sunlight turning off on the horizon. The wind howled loudly and some droplets of rain started wetting the trees at a steady rythm.

Gabrielle was trembling with fever, her thoughts fogged by the violent feelings that persecuted her. She heard a lightning struck, into the distance.

Once again, her sister came to the mind. Her screams, her blood flowing between the legs made her feeling disgust for herself, she almost wanted to commit suicide, but she couldn't.

The thought of not being able to see her again was too unbearable.

The girl stepped in the gravel, overcoming the ambulance station and looking for a rear entrance. She had to think straight if she wanted to see her sister again, but the fever prevented her from doing it.

Luckily for her, a side entrance was open, letting her into the hospital. Once inside, she could smell the odor of bleach that usually fill the hospitals' air.

Climbing the stairs, she found a sheet of paper hanging on the wall which indicated the directions for the hospital wards. She swept the finger on the sheet, looking for the correct entry.

Finally she spotted the item 'traumatology' and headed towards the way shown by the arrow.

"What are you doing here?" - A voice suddenly spoke behind her. Gabrielle turned too see who was talking and she saw her sister, wrapped in a hospital gown, who stared at her, frightened.

"Gayoon..." - She murmured, approaching to the younger girl.

The sandy-haired girl took a step backward, keeping distant from the girl. - "Stay away from me, slut!" - She shouted. - "Was it not enough to see me covered with blood while you penetrated me with your fingers? Huh?"

"Let me explain... I didn't want to do such things to you..." - Gabrielle replied, running after her. - "I was not myself when I did it..."

"I won't let you explain anything" - Her younger sister replied, down in tears. - "I trusted you and you betrayed me... I wanted to forgive you, I wanted to forget all the horrible things that you did... but you didn't deserve it..."

Before she could even reply, the ward's main door opened, letting in a policeman and some men of the hospital security.

The police officer blocked Gabrielle and handcuffed her. - "Gabrielle J. Heo, you're under arrest for having raped and abused Heo Gayoon. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law..."

"...you have the right to an attorney present during questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. Do you understand these rights?" - The man concluded.

Gabrielle didn't reply anything, letting the men take her away. Gayoon watched the scene, appalled, with the tears rushing down her face now uncontrollable. She wept silently, until the men of the security had finally left the room.

 

A hand touched carefully her shoulder. - "Could we talk...?"

The girl moved her sandy-hair away from her face, too see who was being talking by. The police officer smiled at her, offering his hand to lead her inside of the room. - "Your sister won't bother you again..." - He began.

The man took a folder out of his jacket. - "This document proves that your sister is not mentally infirm, thus giving us a possibility to send her to the jail. The problem is..." - He met the girl's gaze. - "That we both know this is a fake..."

"How did you get it?" - Gayoon asked.

The policeman sighed, knowing that he couldn't theoretically reveal it. - "A woman named Rebecca Jackson gave it us..."

Gayoon turned towards the window, thoughtful. So, that was the final question: whether to send her sister to the jail or give her the chance to get admitted to a psychiatric clinic.

"I know what are you thinking about... she abused you and she deserves to be punished. But the jail won't help her... once out, she could rape other people. Other childs... give her the possibility to be cured..."

The girl looked into his eyes - "Can you guarantee that I won't see her again?"

Being given a slight nod, the girl agreed. - "Allow her to be given the mental illness, and send her in a clinic... this is not any of my business anymore".

Taking his leave, he nodded. Gayoon wanted to be strong, and not to cry, but she couldn't... once the police officer had left, the tears started flowing onto her cheeks again, wetting her skin.

She went out on the terrace, trying to get some fresh air to relieve the stress that had built up in the last hours.

Just when everything seemed to break down, not to have any sense anymore, Gayoon saw a person stepping on the hospital driveway... Her short black hair, her jeans, her hooded sweatshirt... everything of her seemed to be the most beautiful thing on the earth to see.

Jiyoon was here too see her...

 

Jiyoon was walking in the rain entered into the building, almost running. Her heartbeat was quickened as she neared the person who she loves. Stepping on the stairs, she was almost crying of joy at the thought to see her...

The years of pain and suffering was finished... she just wanted to go there and kiss her soft lips.

She found her room and went in, the girl couldn't just wait more. Gayoon wore a white nightgown, wet because of the rain and her hair was sweaty, but to Jiyoon's eyes she was the most beautiful girl living on the planet.

"Hi..." - Jiyoon said, meeting her gaze. She could lose in those dark eyes, wanting stay there, forever.

They hugged tightly, both with their eyes teary.

Slowly, they finally they exchanged a warm kiss, clutching each other passionately, and enjoying every second of that blissful and sensual moment, as if there were no tomorrow...

"I love you Jiyoon..."

"I love you Gayoon..."


Chapter 50
Epilogue


3 Years Later, Salinas, Monterey County, United States of America

Gayoon sat on the reef, listening to the sound of the waves. The Pacific Ocean stood out there, mighty and endless with that clear blue water and the warm little breeze that messed her hair.

The sandy-haired girl kept admiring silently that wonderful sight until a voice called her loudly.

She turned towards the voice, and her smile deepened as she saw her girlfriend, Jiyoon, standing there. Her black hair, that she used to wear short, was slowly growing and were held together by a hair pin.

Jiyoon had a two-years old girl embraced in her arms. - "Do you mind holding your daughter for a few seconds?" - she joked, giving the child to the other girl, who embraced her carefully.

It had not been very easy to adopt a child for them, especially in a state such as California that doesn't allow gay marriages... but a years earlier they had managed to it.

Jeon-Heo Hyejin smiled at them, while her mother softly patted her cheeks.

With the baby in her arms, Gayoon stepped on the sand with her girlfriend on her side, walking towards their house. A few months earlier, they had finally decided to buy that house on the seaside which they were looking for.

Once in, Jiyoon ran into the kitchen. - "I have to remove the stuff from the oven, Jihyun and Daniel will be here any minute..."

 

After a few minutes, they finally heard the bell ring and Jiyoon went to open the door. Jihyun entered the door and hugged tightly both Jiyoon and Gayoon, giving a peck to the baby's head too.

"How are you, guys?" - She asked with a deep sigh, hanging the coat on the coat hook. - "We have so many things to talk about..."

They all sat on the comfortable couch while Jiyoon handed everyone a glass of wine. - "So what about you two?" - Jiyoon asked the other couple. - "Are you planning to get settled or will you live forever in our old house?"

"Speaking of getting settled..." - Jihyun said - "we got news for you..." - then, the red-haired girl gave a brief look at her boyfriend, asking for the permission to reveal the news. Being given a nod, she continued - "I'm pregnant..."

The two girl gasped, hearing that. - "Oh my god, Jihyun this is wonderful!"

Jihyun grimaced. - "I don't know..." - She said - "I'm very happy and all, guys, but what if I am not a good mother?"

"Don't be afraid... being a mother is easier that you think" - Gayoon patted her friend's shoulder - "Would you ever have though that I could be a mother?" - the sandy-haired girl laughed - "If a girl like me can be a good mom you'll be a perfect one..."

"Yeah but you didn't have to pass your daughter through your cunt..." - The older girl added, receiving a playful slap on the arm.

Jiyoon covered Hyejin's ears, to prevent her from listening to the swarm of profanities. The little girl half-closed her eyes, and as her mom cuddled her, she had began to doze off.

"Speaking of cunts..." - the black-haired girl continued - "have you got any news from Hyuna?"

The atmosphere seemed to drop, hearing that name. - "Actually, I didn't... to be honest, I tried to contact her, but she doesn't want to answer my calls and she doesn't even reply my e-mails..."

"Nevermind..." - Jiyoon replied coldly - "I won't waste my time looking for a person who doesn't want to be my friend..."

Seeing her frustration inside of her eyes, Gayoon gave her a soft kiss on the lips - "...don't let Hyuna ruin your mood. She is your past and I'm your present, keep that in mind..." - She chuckled - "...you know that I get jealous easily"

Jiyoon smiled. Whenever those bad memories about Hyuna would come to her mind, her girlfriend would chase them away, with her sweet giggle. Once again, she remembered the first time they met...

Gayoon hadn't change so much, after all. She still had this firmness and stubbornness that Jiyoon had fallen in love with, yet she was gentle and mild deep inside.

 

After having dinner together, and once Jihyun and Daniel had left, the two lovers returned to their room, undressing to get ready for sleep. Hyejin was sleeping soundly in the next room.

The moon was full, and its candid light shone in the sky, illuminating their half-naked body.

Jiyoon was lost in the contemplation of that perfect body, those perfect features that shaped the other girl. Grabbing her hand, Jiyoon clung tightly to her, their chests touching each other, and kissed Gayoon deeply.

"Do you promise me that our love will never finish?" - The latter asked.

"I promise".
